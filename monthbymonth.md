<p>We picked the boat up in the last week of August. Joe and Kirsty were volunteering at a nearby music festival and wanted to meet up. We worked out that Norton Junction would be a good place to meet up with relatively good access to a railway station for Joe to return to after our cruise.</p>
<p>We had a little bit of time so we travelled the few miles to Weedon Bec and back.

<p>Joe and Kirsty joined us for a couple of days and left us at Rugby. We then cruised on to Coventry with a plan to meet up with Robin there.</p>

<p>While we went to a family gathering in Bristol, Robin and Ben borrowed the boat and cruised from Coventry to Nuneaton and back. </p>

<p>We had made arrangements to collect Mary for a cruise starting in Birmimham so we made our way there via Tamworth and Salford Junction.</p>

<p>With Mary on board we cruised to Stratford upon Avon and then back towards Leamington Spa where Mary was due to go home from.</p>

<p>We completed our journey from Stratford upon Avon to Leamington Spa via Warwick. We went back home with Mary.</p>

<p>When we first got the boat, we had ordered a sofa bed and needed to collect it once it was delivered to our house. We wanted to be reasonably close to home for this as I would have to bring the sofa bed to the boat in a hire van and then drive back home the same day to drop off the van. We thought that Norton Junction might be a good place to do this but it was too soon to go there just yet.</p>

<p>So on our return from home we cruised to Northampton and back to Braunston.</p>

<p>We made a plan on 14th for Joe and Kirtsy to have the boat on the Lllanollen Canal over Christmas.</p>

<p>This was a month of complicated logistics so we could not relax.</p>

<p>Our sofa bed delivery was late so we could not wait at Norton Junction for its arrival.</p>

<p>Joe and Kirsty wanted to use the boat while we were away from it at Christmas and I had hoped to let them have it on the Llangollen  canal - very pretty and with the advantage of decent towns with pubs and resaurants. But we had checked on the winter closures and discovered that we could not get through Birmingham for several months.</p>
 
<p>So, our plans had to change. They could have the boat at Oxford and we could pick up the sofa bed somewhere on the way.</p>

<p>One of the locks at Napton was due to close for repair so we had to travel fairly quickly to get there before it closed. We would be confined to the Oxford Canal for the winter but when we got our license for the River Thames in January we could go down the Thames on our way to visit Cathy in Bristol.</p>

<p>We also had a date for solar panels to be installed so we needed to be somewhere conveniently close to a road at the appropriate date.</p>

<p>To make things worse I had also ordered some new garage doors back in the summer and they were due to be delivered some time soon.</p>

<p>We managed to get to Napton before the lock closure and then to Marston Doles where I delivered the sofa bed.</p>

<p>We decided that Cropredy would be a good place to have the solar panels installed so cruised on to there.</p>

<p>Then we moved on to Banbury where another closure was due.</p>

<p>We went home from Banbury to receive and fit the garage doors and sadly Tarka became ill and was put down while we were at home.</p>

<p>Now, we only needed to find somewhere for Joe and Kirsty to pick up the boat so we cruised towards Oxford stopping at various places on the way.</p>

<p>We didn't quite make it to Oxford as we thought we woiuld need a River Thames licence to do so. On our way we discovered Thrupp and thought that this would be an ideal place for Joe and Kirsty to collect the boat over Christmas so we set off back to Thrupp and left the boat there.</p>

<p>Joe and Kirsty had left the boat in Banbury and Joe brought some of our luggage to us after we had returned to the boat. We cruised to Cropredy and back with Joe.</p>

<p>We discovered a flaw in our plan to trabvel down the Thames and onto the Kennet and Avon Canal. A lock on the Thames was closed so we had to abandon our plan for a family gathering for Mary's birthday on the boat in Newbury.</p>

<p>We decided to travel to Oxford again with a little more time to stop off on the way. We ended up stopping at Thrupp again as Cathy and Will were planning to visit us.</p>

<p>With them on board we cruised to Oxford and back over a couple of days. We ventured onto the River Thames briefly.</p>

<p>Finally we returned to Banbury where we were due to collect a Hire Car to travel home and to the family gathering at Newbury.</p>

<p>We had two sets of visitors planning to visit us in Cropredy so we set off for there. We cruised a few miles North and back with each of our visitors.</p>

<p>We had decided that as the River Thames was not yet an options we needed to find somewhere else to go. We dicovered that we could go to Nottingham!</p>

<p>We cruised to Braunston, Norton Junction and past Crick where we had bought the boat and carried on towards Leicester.</p>

<p>On the way we did the Welford Arm and the Market Harborough arm.</p>

<p>We made it to Leicester and then to Loughborough where we were trapped between two stretches of river in flood.</p>

<p>When the river opened we set off south again trying to get back to the River Thames as soon as possible as we had plans to go to Bristol as soon as the lock on the Thames was open.</p>

<p>On our way we had a request from Joe to meet up to do some work converting his new van to a camper van. We made our way quickly to Norton Junction as we knew where he could park and work on the van.</p>

<p>We then moved on and got all the way to Banbury where we planned to travel home.

<p>After some time spent at home we returned to the boat at Banbury and set off with plans to go on the River Thames to the Kennet and Avon Canal to Bristol.</p>

<p>We managed this, collecting Mary at Bath and met up with Cathy. After three days on Bristol Cathy came back to Bath with us.</p>

<p>Mary left us at Bradford on Avon and we carried on back along the Kennet and Avon Canal, onto the River Thames at Reading.</p>

<p>We cruised the Thames to Brentford and the joined the Grand Union Canal and took the Paddington Arm. We stayed in Paddington for a full week sightseeing.</p>

<p>We left Paddington and cruised the Regents Canal and then did a small loop to Limehouse, along the Limehouse Cut and back to the Regents Canal along a short stretch of the Hertford Union Canal.</p>

<p>We then needed to get to Leamington Spa where we plannedto moor while we got atrain to Cornwall to camp with friends.<p>

<p>So, back along the Regents Canal,the Paddington Arm of the Grand Union Canal back to the Grand Union Canal.</p>

<p>We found time to do the Wendover Arm near Tring and Aylesbury Arm before heading to Milton Keynes where Cathy joined as for a weekend cruising to Norton Junction.</p>

<p>Our route continued through Braunston and Napton Junction until we reached Leamington Spa where we left Liberty Belle for a couple of weeks.</p>

<p>On returning to Liberty Belle after of spell in Cornwall we wanted to get to Yorkshire fairly quickly fearing that the Yorkshire canals would close due to lack of water as happened last year.</p>

<p>So we followed the Grand Union to Birmingham and Salford Junction and then joined the Birmingham and Fazeley canal. At Fazeley Junction we turned onto the Coventry Canal and headed fro Fradley Junction.</p>

<p>The Trent and Mersey Canal took us to Lichfied, Rugeley, Great Haywood, Stone and Stoke on Trent to Newcastle under lyme and kidsgrove.</p>

<p>We joined the Macclesfield Canal and travelled through Congleton, Macclesfield and Bollington to Marple.</p>

<p>At Ashton-under-Lyne a short stretch of the Ashton Canal took us to Manchester.</p>

<p>We followed the Rochdale Canal to Littleborough.</p>

<p>Our travels round Yorkshire and Lancashire took us alomg the Rochdale Canal and the Calder and Hebble Navigation to Todmorden, Hebden Bridge, Sowerby Bridge, Elland, near Halifax, Brighouse and Wakefield.</p>

<p>This was followed by a spell on the Aire and Calder Navigation to Castleford and then on to Leeds where we joined the Leeds and Liverpool Canal.</p>

<p>We continued to Saltaire, through the Bingley locks to Silsden, and one of our favourites, Skipton.</p>

<p>We completed the month by travelling through Gargrave to Barnoldswick.</p>

<p>We were now on a mission to reach Liverpool to collect Mary for a cruise to Chester.</p>

<p>The Leeds and Liverpool Canal through Burnley and Blackburn was horrendous with shallow and weedy stretches which resulted in Liberty Belle damaging her propeller.</p>

<p>Our journey through Chorley and Wigan was better though the damaged propeller made the journey less restfull with a juddering rudder. We didn't have to option of booking in to a boatyard for repairs as we had to get to Liverpool on time.</p>

<p>We passed by the Lancaster Canal as we didn't have time to explore there but carried on with haste to Liverpool where we had a booking for a specifc date. The last few miles on the canal were slow due to the shallowness and the wind made it tricky.</p>

<p>After a few days in Liverpool we retraced our path to Wigan and followed the Bridgewater Canal to Worsley and the outskirts of Manchester. We passed tghrough Sale which was a surprisingly nice modern town. We joined the Trent and Mersly Canbal at Preston Brook and took a brief trip on the Anfderton Boat Lift onto the River Weaver and back.</p>

<p>We continued through the more bleak lansdscape near Northwich to the prettier Maddlewich. Here we went along the shprtest of Britains canals, the Wardle Canal, only a few yards long bridging the gap to the Shropshire Union Canal (Middlewich Branch).</p>

<p>The Shropshire Union Canal then took us past Beeston Castle and into Chester.</p>

<p>After Mary left for home we had a quick trip to Ellesmere Port and back to Chester and then started our return along the Shropshire Union with a plan to visit the Lllangollen Canal.</p>

<p>We set off through the narow lock at Hurlston and then through Whitchurch to Ellesmere. We had done this trip on a hire boat shortly before we bought our boat so did not hang about.</p>

<p>We made it to Chirk and then over the Pontcysyllte Aqueduct onto the last stretch down to Lllangollen. We were a little concerned that the canal might be too shallow for us as the draught of Liberty Belle was listed as greater than that recommended for this part of the canal. But all went well and when I measured our draught using the boat hook it seems that it wasn't as big as we thought.</p>

<p>After a few days we headed back, stopping this time to do the short Prees Branch and the longer, more rural Mongomery Canal.</p>

<p>Next we visited Natwich, Liberty Belle's home town and up the Audlem and Adderley locks to Market Drayton.</p>

<p>We passed through Tyrley locks,Norbury Junction and Gnosall Heath to Wheaton Aston where we had a short delay due to a lock closure and then on to Brewood and Autherley Junction where the long flight of 21 locks to Wolverhampton started.</p>

<p>We spent the night moored outside the lovely Black Country Museum and then headed into the city where we moored in Cambrian Wharf in central Birmimgham.</p>
