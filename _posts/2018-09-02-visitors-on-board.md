<p>In the very early hours of Monday morning we welcomed Joe and Kirsty aboard as our first visitors. We gave them the bedroom and tested the dinette conversion to double bed ourselves. Very comfy.</p>

<p>We caught up on some sleep and had a late start. We stopped off at Norton Junction to empty the toilet cassette (yuk!) and Tony discovered that you shouldn't push the vent button until the cassette is inverted, empty our bins, take on more water and load Joe's car up with the bits and pieces that we had decided not to keep on board.</p>

<p>It's great having extra crew! Kirsty quickly got the hang of the locks and we sped on. (It's all relative!)</p>

<p>We moored up at Braunston. I prepared late lunch whilst the others went off to explore and find the shops. We all had an afternoon nap followed by a quiet evening. Tarka wandered aimlessly around  Braunston marina before being forced back on the boat. We drank the complimentary bottle of prosecco and toasted Liberty Belle. Another late night with meals at random times throughout the day!</p>
