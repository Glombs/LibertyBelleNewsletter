<p>We had been banished to the house for an uncertain amount of time whilst waiting to hear from the boatyard. Liberty Belle's dry dock in Brinklow was actually an old widebeam hull with a lift-up section at the front which can be raised to let water in and allow a narrowboat to be driven inside. Being a boat itself, the dry dock can be floated into position behind the boat that is going to enter it. The front section is then lowered back into place and the water pumped out, allowing access to the narrowboat's hull. Genius.</p>

<p>If you are baffled by my description of the dry dock and want to know what it is really like, this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TiOyp4xkLfs">YouTube video of Brinklow's Floating Dry Dock</a> might help </p>

<p>To cut a long story short, Liberty Belle didn't have her propeller repaired but instead, had her original propeller, (replaced some time in the past and housed in the engine bay), re-fitted. Her bottom was blacked (in two stages because of unfavourable weather conditions) and a few other little jobs completed that had been recommended when we had her survey done.</p>

<p>Finally, on Wednesday 11th December, she was ready to be collected. We drove back in the hire car to a convenient parking space where the road meets the canal, near Brinklow, and walked the muddy route to the boatyard where she was waiting for us. Once on board, we eased our way between all the moored boats to the end of the arm, turned and headed off to the parking space where we loaded the contents of the car into the boat. Tony then drove the hire car into Brinklow, parked and walked back to the boat.</p>

<p>Off we went to Rugby. Initially we weren't very impressed by the propeller, as we seemed to be struggling, but it turned out that we had picked up a large sheet of plastic that was causing the problem. Once that was removed we were off like a shot! With her original propeller in place, Liberty Belle seemed much faster. Apparently, the one that was in place when we bought her was designed to be equally efficient for travelling forwards or in reverse.... As we spend most of our time cruising forwards, hopefully we gain more than we lose.</p>

<p>We moored overnight in Rugby and the following morning Tony caught a bus to Brinklow, collected the hire car and returned it to Enterprise.</p>

<p> We then set off for Hillmorton locks, where one of the pounds was short of water, which slowed us down a bit whilst we topped it up. 
The following morning we arrived outside the chandlers in Braunston just as they were opening and bought ourselves 12 bags of coal. (They store their coal indoors here, so it stays dry. Last year we had a lot of wet coal which doesn't create much heat....you live and learn.)</p>

<p>As we made our way through Braunston we were greeted by a very friendly lady who had heard about us from our newsletter friends, Lin and Charles. It was exciting to be recognised, we felt like celebrities! We didn't have time to stop though, because we had promised ourselves a curry in Weedon Bec if we got there early enough....</p>

<p>So, through Braunston Locks and Tunnel, to Norton Junction. Through 7 locks there, (including the one we nearly sank in, right back at the beginning), which were heavy and difficult, partly due to an excess of water.  Then, finally, we arrived! Not only were we in time for a meal out, but we were able to go for a leisurely drink beforehand too. It was our third visit to this particular Indian Restaurant - we are practically regulars!</p>

<p>The following day was very windy but we soldiered on regardless, which was a mistake. At one of the locks Tony brought Liberty Belle into the side and held onto her centre rope as it was too windy to just drift about waiting for me to open the gate. There was a sudden gust of wind which took him by surprise and he fell backwards, giving himself a large bump on the back of his head. I was rather worried, thinking he might suddenly collapse later in the day.</p>

<p>As it turned out, we were joined by another boat, so he was kept chatting by the helmsman (or rather, woman), so at least she would notice if something was wrong. Her partner, working the locks with me, was also quite chatty, so we were both entertained.</p>

<p>The young couple had met doing the Argentine Tango, which takes them all over the world (I guess they don't tango all the way there and back...). They decided to give up their rented flat in London and buy a boat to live on instead. They work from home and only need to be in London occasionally so it suits them well. They were very up-beat, happy and pleasant people. Their boat is called 'So Long'; see what they did there?</p>

<p>We finished the day by eating leftover curry. It was just as yummy as it had been the day before.</p>

<p>Tony didn't suffer any ill effects from his accident and the egg-sized lump gradually went away over the next couple of days. Another lesson learnt (possibly) - tie your boat securely when waiting for a lock...</p>

<p>The weather slowly cheered up over the next two days and we had several sightings of deer and kingfishers. We passed through Milton Keynes without stopping, as we wanted to get a little nearer to Berkhamsted where the canal was due to close for repairs on 7th January. We didn't want to be under too much pressure immediately after Christmas.</p>

<p>At Marsworth we found an ideal mooring; amongst other boats, outside a private house with plenty of people passing backwards and forwards. We decided that Liberty Belle would be safe there for the two weeks over Christmas. It did mean we had over 2 miles to walk along the muddy towpath to get to the railway station the following morning, but we travelled light and got there in plenty of time to catch our train to Eastleigh. (Chandlers Ford station was closed because of rail strikes...)</p>

 <p>*Apparently there is some doubt about the name of the Cosgrove bridge.
In Feb 1996 the Parish Clerk tries to cover his arse in a local newsletter....</p>
 <p>The image reads...</p>
 <p>ORNAMENTAL BRIDGE - BRIDGE ROAD: As neither British Waterways, Village historians nor Older residents can agree, i.e., Solomons or Samsons Bridge. (British Waterways, know it as Solomons Bridge but can't confirm the origin of that name). The clerk to avoid embarassment and, in an attempt to remain neutral as a non resident, intends to refer to it by the above title from now on. As you read this, it is hoped that work has already commenced on the bridge and its approaches as previously reported.</p>

<h2>Where Next?</h2>

<p>We are currently moored in Berkhamsted and have been exploring the local area. As yet we haven't done any planning at all! We will let you know when we have.</p>

<p>Happy New Year everyone.</p>
