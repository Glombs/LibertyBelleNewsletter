<p>On Thursday 23rd August 2018 we packed a van, drove to Crick, dumped our belongings into our boat and cruised into Crick tunnel! The plan was to moor somewhere after the Watford flight of locks and for Tony to then walk all the way back (6 miles or so) to the van in the evening and drive home, leaving Tarka and myself to sleep on Liberty Belle, without Tony, for our first night. Tony was then to travel, the next day, by train to the station at Long Buckby and join us as soon as he could.</p>

<p>The plan was soon changed when we arrived at the locks and were refused entry. The flight of locks is manned by volunteers and were due to close at 5 to conserve precious water. There were boats already making their way up towards us and there would be no time to see us down. We couldn't moor at the lock as we would be there for too long so had to reverse the boat to a suitable mooring space a few yards back, just under the M1!</p>

<p>On the plus side, Tony had a short walk back to the van; on the negative side he would have a much longer walk along the towpath to join us the next day.</p>

<p>After a meal of 3 mini pork pies each, (which were actually bought as treats for Tarka), and a cup of tea, Tony headed off and unable to find a chip shop in Crick resorted to a family bag of Tyrell's crisps and a couple of pints of milk to get him through the drive home.</p>

<p>I did some cleaning (using Tony's toothbrush to clean the fridge seal), putting away and made up the bed. So tired I knew I would sleep well.....</p>

<p>It was cold. Why on earth is there so much ventilation on the boat? The mattress was uncomfortable. The motorway was noisy. I had too much going around in my head. I didn't sleep well.</p>
