<p>There we were in Kingston Upon Thames as the restrictions for limiting the virus were coming into effect.</p>

<p>Cathy managed to book herself a train journey from Kingston on Thames for the morning after we arrived there. Luckily she made it home before the lockdown came into effect and avoided being stranded with us. A holiday is one thing, but that might have been a step too far for her!</p>

<p>After waving Cathy off, we joined the socially distanced queue outside Waitrose and stocked up on groceries. Then we went for a walk, following the Thames to Richmond.</p>

<p>We stayed a second night in Kingston and then moved on to Sunbury. On the way a moored boater shouted a warning that the lock we were approaching was closed due to a sunken boat blocking passage. Oh heck! He managed to pass on directions to some pleasant 24 hour moorings at the edge of a tiny public park. That was good of him because the mooring on the lock approach was full.</p>

<p>As it happened, the following morning we received instructions from the Canal & River Trust and the Environment Agency to stop moving, along with the news that all mooring restrictions were now lifted.</p>

<p>In the terms of our 'continuous cruiser' licence we are normally obliged to move regularly, observing the mooring restrictions of up to 14 days in one place and travelling at least 25 miles in a year. This obviously suited us under normal circumstances. Now that the circumstances were far from normal, we were obliged to remain where we were.</p>

<p>We could have chosen at this stage to go back to our house but we have someone living there at the moment so we were concerned about the domino effect that our return would cause. Plus, Liberty Belle is on a mooring where the water levels alter daily and we would have had no way of checking on her for an unknown amount of time. So, with all things considered, we decided to stay.</p>

<p>Thank goodness we didn't wait for a less windy day to travel the tidal section of the Thames, otherwise we would have been in the London Docklands area when we were asked to stop travelling, which may not have been quite as pleasant.</p>

 <p>Our nearest bridge over the Thames is Walton Bridge.</p>

<p>Of course we are allowed to move Liberty Belle to fetch water and to empty the loo...! This involves a 6 mile round trip back to Molesey Lock, where the nearest facilities are. We cannot turn around this side of the lock because there is a danger of getting sucked against the weir, so we have to actually pass through the lock, turn on the other side and go straight back into the lock to operate it again.</p>

<p>Under normal circumstances, this large lock is electrically operated but now we have to use a wheel and levers which operate it hydraulically. This is to deter people from using it and to lessen the need for a lock keeper to be present.</p>

<p>The once-a-week water ritual seems to take for ever and is no small effort, but we are in no rush...</p>

<p>Apart from the concerns that we all have at this time, we also wonder what we will do if we run out of cooking gas or diesel... Having investigated, Tony has located a chap that will deliver gas, so we hope he is still operating when we need him. We think we have enough coal.</p>

<p>We are safe, comfortable and feeling lucky. We are moored against a narrow public park where people come to feed the ducks, geese and swans. Liberty Belle is positioned at the end of the park where there is no reason for people to walk past us, so we have quite a private section of path at the back of the boat.</p>

<p>Within walking distance we have a choice of supermarkets, some bins and a few small green spaces. We have a routine of sorts, which mainly revolves around meal times and our 3 o'clock bun!</p>

<p>Our boaty neighbour is a friendly chap trying to cope with two dogs that are used to rather more freedom. He takes them to a nearby park where they can take a dip in the river. He is only a short distance from his private moorings which are unfortunately the other side of the sunken boat...</p>

<p>Apart from our human visitors to the park we have a pair each of swans, Egyptian Geese and Mandarin ducks, several parakeets, Canada Geese, Mallards and black headed gulls, and a squirrel to watch, with regular appearances by a Great Crested Grebe, a cormorant, a swimmer, stand-up paddle boarders, kayakers, rowing boats and a chap on a hydroplane board. (A passer-by and I decided the hydroplaner must be James Bond, currently furloughed.) Tony has also seen a kingfisher on several occasions which only goes to prove that he has the best seat in the boat.</p>

<p>I know some of you will be busier than you have ever been but if others of you have run out of things to do, you can always read the newsletter archive - just click on the blue button on the top of this email. The archive follows the format of a blog which means the most recent entry is at the top, so, to read them in the correct order, you can click on the word 'Posts' on the top right, then choose the top title, which is the first entry from August 2018. That lot should keep you busy!</p> 

<p>I will send another newsletter when I have anything to report...</p>

<p>No fever to report yet, except maybe a touch of cabin fever...</p>

<p>(If we do catch the virus, I will blame the Tesco shoppers.)</p>

<p>We have now run out of excuses and have started to address Liberty Belle's rust patches.</p>

<p>Look after yourselves. Tony and I welcome emails, it would be lovely to hear from you.</p>
