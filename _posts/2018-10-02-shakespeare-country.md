<p>Off we went again towards along the pretty Stratford canal, crossing two aqueducts on the way.  We moored for the night outside Wootton Wawen next to another Liberty Belle. An impostor! Accept no substitutes!</p>

<p>Again we were tempted by a craft village. It turned out to be closed when we got there. Another closed craft village. When we returned to the boat and re-read the sign it did inform us that the craft village was closed on Mondays, and, we all agreed, it was, after all, Monday.</p>

<p>The village did contain the oldest church in Warwickshire, which we were able to explore, an excellent village shop and an apple tree. We took back some of the apples and added blackberries collected by Mary. We had a fine pud!</p>

<p>We moored up outside the village of Wilmcote for the night. On investigating Mary Arden's House (apparently she was Shakespeare's Mother...) we found we had stayed all day so stopped for a second night. The house turned out to be a Tudor Farm. The actor/historian staff were informative and fun, and the weather was perfect. Mary and Tony learnt to herd geese whilst we were there - you never know when that might come in handy.</p>

<p>During the evening Tony walked into Stratford-Upon-Avon from Wilmcote along the towpath and brought back some supplies from the supermarket. He was gone for a couple of hours. We did the journey with Liberty Belle the next day. Lots of very tricky locks and another wedgie later and we were there. It took 8 hours!
We initially moored up alongside the towpath, just outside the basin in the centre of Stratford. We spent the day looking around the town and visiting the Shakespeare museums (oh yes, and eating fish and chips in the park outside the Royal Shakespeare Theatre.) We then moved Liberty Belle into the basin. It wasn't expected to be easy as there was a bit of a wind and we had an audience...</p>

<p>After a couple of attempts at getting into line between two other moored boats, our future neighbour took pity on us and hauled us into place with our rope. Tony bowed to the watching public when we were finally pulled into place...! Our other neighbour informed us that it had nothing to do with skill or lack of it. Thankyou Sir.</p>

<p>That evening, when Tony tried to step onto the boat, he discovered that what looked like the edge of the pontoon in shadow was, in fact, the water. With one leg in the canal and a slightly bruised hip he heard a disheartening 'plop' as his glasses fell and sank. The following day after much anguish and wearing an old pair of glasses held together up with duck tape, Tony bought a fishing net from Argos and trawled the canal where his glasses fell in. After sifting through his second haul of canal silt (yuk!) he actually found them! Thank goodness!</p>
