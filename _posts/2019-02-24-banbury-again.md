<h2>Aynho, back to Banbury then forward to Cropredy, repeatedly!</h2>

<h2>28th January-18th February 2019</h2>

<p>As we cruised closer, we could smell Banbury on the air!

<p>Banbury has several factories - Fine Lady Bakery, Jacobs (of cracker fame), Dowe Egberts amongst others. The combined smell from all of these is quite distinctive but unidentifiable. I think it smells of burnt molasses, Tony likens it to burnt jacket potato skins and Joe can pick out the coffee aroma. Depending on the wind strength and direction this smell can follow the canal for miles!</p>

<p>We had arrived a few days ahead of schedule but the precaution proved necessary as the canal did indeed re-freeze.
We had noticed some signs for the 'Banbury Fringe Walk' near the boat so we decided to investigate. It took us on a circular route through the countryside surrounding Banbury, including the village of Bodicote.</p>

<p>We left Liberty Belle in Banbury for a few days as we needed to get home for a family get-together to celebrate my Mum’s birthday. After a successful celebration - eating, drinking and catching up, we returned.</p>

<p>As the canal was again frozen we assumed that the ground would also be solid, so we thought we could go on a short country walk without fear of getting too muddy. How wrong we were.</p>

<p>We set off thinking we would be back for lunch. Four and a half hours later my head ached, my feet ached and every muscle in between. Our lunch had been a shared packet of chilli coated peanuts in the porch of a church. We had walked across fields with mud so deep we had nearly lost our boots on several occasions. Being fed up with that we had taken a slightly different route along an old railway. This wide route soon became rough ground with fallen trees to clamber over. Finally, to descend to the road we had to scramble down a bramble covered bank then under a fence, booby trapped with barbed wire, into busy traffic. We sidled along behind the crash barrier until we rejoined the path. Finally we made it into Banbury via an industrial estate and confusing residential road network. I was so pleased to see Liberty Belle.</p>

<p>The ice had disappeared from the canal and, needing water, we moved the few yards up to the water tap which turned out not to be in working order. The next step was a lock which was full of dumped newspapers, piles of them. Tony used the boat hook to remove the paper to the lock edge whilst I and a helpful gentleman transported the heavy, dripping mess to the bins a few yards away. Just beyond the lock was a second tap which was, thankfully, working.  We filled up the water tank, passed under the lift bridge and moored up without further incident. The few hundred yards between moorings took an hour and a half....</p>

<p>We spent the rest of the week in the centre of Banbury then left Liberty Belle alone again whilst we went off to Stafford for the weekend. Tony attended a two day boat engineering course there and I did a bit of sightseeing. I liked Stafford. It has a small but very interesting (and free) museum; a pleasant public park with an aviary; a modern library with comfy(ish) seats and local history books; a handsome church which has regular Saturday concerts (also free); a rather delightful Whetherspoons in an old cinema (with the traditional free WiFi and free hot drinks top-ups); and friendly locals. What more could I want??</p>

<p>On our return Tony was suddenly concerned about the welfare of Liberty Belle’s engine and started frantically trying to purchase essential bits and bobs. It was amazing how difficult it was to buy parts for boat engines in an area full of boats. Resorting in the end to ordering the engine oil he needed on Amazon, Tony had it delivered to an Amazon locker. What an excellent resource! The filters he needed were purchased locally. One of them, despite reassurances that it was compatible, wasn’t, so had to be returned after several attempts to attach the blessed thing. In this manner several days went by...</p>

<p>Once Tony had finished giving Liberty Belle's engine a well-earned spruce up we left Banbury for Cropedy. We moored up there for lunch and I spent the afternoon preparing for our much-anticipated visitors arriving over the next 2 days.</p>

<p>We spent the weekend showing off Liberty Belle to our guests and travelling up and down a couple of miles of canal. We showed them how to steer and work the locks. Great fun and no accidents!</p>

<p>On the Monday morning we took Liberty Belle back along the now well known stretch of canal and beyond - heading in the general direction of Nottingham.</p>

<p>Over the next few days we noticed that nature was looking ahead to spring. We saw a tiny, isolated patch of new hawthorn leaves; a little willow twig with tiny 'pussy-cat' paws; a single butterfly (I am tempted to say it was a Painted Lady, but don't quote me); and a rook carrying a twig. The rook didn't seem to know where to put this twig as he flew around in an undecided sort of way with it in his beak. Maybe he was new to this and felt the urge to collect twigs but wasn't yet sure why...</p>

<p>On the other hand, it is still jolly cold and we are still using coal at an alarming rate!</p>
