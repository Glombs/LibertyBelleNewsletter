<p>It was a wet Saturday in Thrupp...</p>

<p>"The sun did not shine. It was too wet to play. So we sat in the boat. All that cold, cold, wet day".</p>

<p>Tony was busy with some wiring, I was cooking in preparation for Cathy and Will's arrival for their first visit to see Liberty Belle. I know! What took them so long? Suddenly a figure emerged through the curtain of rain with a large umbrella and banged on the boat. It was Robin! He had arrived for a surprise visit. After a cuppa Robin got roped into helping with the wiring whilst I finished my cooking.</p>

<p>"I know it is wet and the sun is not sunny, but we can have lots of good fun that is funny."</p>

<p>So we gave Robin the full Thrupp experience i.e a meal and a pint at The Jolly Boatman, a pint at The Boat Inn then tea and cake at Annie's cafe. So, fun was had after all!</p>

<p>The next day the rain had stopped and so we set off for a walk to Kidlington. It was a beautiful sunny day but extremely muddy underfoot. We arrived at Kidlington church but, being Sunday, there was a church service in progress so we didn't go in and explore. We continued through the village to the shops and found the public toilets which we couldn't take advantage of because we didn't have the required 10p piece. Oh well, back to the bushes! We returned through the Thrupp Community Woodland. It was a lovely walk but the highlight of the day was spotting roe deer in the fields and amongst the trees.</p>

<p>Cathy and Will arrived on Sunday evening. The long-awaited visit!
We decided to set off straight after breakfast on Monday morning to travel along the Oxford canal and join the Thames at Duke's cut. Our first time on the Thames! All fed and wrapped up against the cold we positioned ourselves at the back of Liberty Belle, ready for the off!!
<p>The engine didn't start.</p>
<p>We gave it a short rest then tried again. Nothing.</p>
<p>We stood around for 15 minutes chatting, waiting for Tony to have a third go.</p>
<p>Ooooo, nearly....! Nope.</p>
<p>Oh well, everyone back inside for a cuppa.Tony thought we ought to have our elevenses a bit early as we would miss them otherwise!</p>

<p>After giving Liberty Belle's engine battery a jolly good rest, Tony snuck out the back and crept up on it, taking it by surprise - this time the engine started! We then had to get our outer clothes back on, but we were finally off!</p>

<p>It was not the early start we had hoped for so the plan was altered. We decided we would travel to Oxford on the canal then return to Thrupp the next day along the Thames, after an early start (!?!) We knew we could moor on the canal if we ran out of daylight but we didn't want to find ourselves negotiating the river in the dark...!</p>

<p>It was a cold and cloudy day but the rain held off. We all took it in turns to take the helm and work the locks and lift bridges.</p>
<p>We arrived at one lift bridge to find a woman just about to cross to take her rubbish bags to the bins on the opposite side. I held back to allow her to cross saying, with a smile "Don't worry, we won't isolate you." She crossed the bridge in silence, went to the bins and on her return, stepping back off the bridge she said "Why would you want to isolate us, we're not convicts".</p>

<p>I am still trying to work that one out.</p>

<p>After a delightful day we moored very close to Oxford.</p>

<p>The following morning, Tony tried the engine early and she started straight away! Great! It was cold but beautifully sunny! So much so that we could hardly see a thing! Luckily we managed to keep out of trouble. Cathy and I worked the first lock and Will took the helm, managing the tricky manoeuvre of turning Liberty Belle in front of the lock to face the river. Beautifully done! (We girls were the muscle, yanking Liberty Belle by the bow rope along the pontoon..)</p>

<p>Cathy took the helm and negotiated the sharp bends on the initial part of the river. Suddenly the Thames was wide and beautiful, with lots to see. Geese, herons, cormorants, red kites, and muntjac deer, not to mention the antics of the dogs being taken out by their owners along the bank.</p>

<p>We had to go through two Thames locks on our journey. In my ignorance I assumed they would be manned by a friendly lock keeper who would pass the time of day with us whilst effortlessly working the lock. On arrival at each one there was a very large sign say self service. Oh.</p>

<p>At Godstow Lock I approached a large console with a keyhole, lots of buttons, (one of which was illuminated), two levers and a wheel. I tried two different keys in the keyhole, tried pressing the illuminated button and just gently tried to see if I could move the wheel. It was like a massive 'Bop-It' game. Confused I had another look around and found, on the opposite side of the console, very detailed instructions! Thank goodness!</p>

<p>After that I thought I would know what I was doing for the next lock.</p>
<p>Really? Nope.</p>

<p>Kings Lock is entirely different, completely manual with no instructions at all. It has huge 'ships wheels' on the gates (with highly technical pieces of rope to hold each wheel in place and stop it turning back again), so I had to stand on the top of the gate and pretend to be Popeye! Great fun.</p>

<p>We then had another sharp turn to return to the Oxford Canal along Dukes Cut. From Dukes lock we retraced out 'steps' to Thrupp. On the way we added a pike to our list of the day's wildlife.</p>

<p>By the time we arrived back at our mooring it was snowing heavily, in complete contrast to the morning's weather. We tied Liberty Belle up and made a dash for Annie's Tea Room for tea and cake.</p>

<p>After a lovely couple of days it was then time for Will and Cathy to brave the weather and drive back to Bristol, which they did without incident.</p>
