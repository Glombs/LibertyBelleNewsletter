<p>Another gentle day. After a little faffing about taking on water and emptying the cassette we set off to Rugby with Kirsty at the helm!</p>

<p>We moored up for lunch then Tony took Liberty Belle through some beautiful locks with myself and Joe operating the gates. We were just in time to pass through the flight before they were closed for the day.</p>

<p>A few more miles and we were in Rugby. We moored up near a Tesco supermarket so that we would be able to replenish our supplies the next morning.</p>

<p>Joe was due to catch a train back to his car so we all walked up to the railway station. Kirsty, Tony and I all went to Wetherspoons to wait for him and to use their free WiFi to send all the Newsletters I had been writing over the last few days. That's why they all came at once! Apologies for that.</p>

<p>After a bite to eat, Kirsty and Joe left for real life. Tony and I returned to Liberty Belle.</p>
