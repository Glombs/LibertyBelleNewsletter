<p>A wet day. We turned the boat just after Weedon and travelled back towards Norton. We stopped briefly at Whilton Marina in the hope of filling our water tank and buying a second windlass (Tony lived in fear of us losing the one we had). We had it explained to us that there is no public water available but as we happened to be visiting the chandlery, a blind eye would be turned as we filled our tank.</p>

<p>I went up to check the locks and discovered that another boat had left the lock but immediately come aground in the shallow water. Ironically it was pouring with rain. The appropriate people were informed by a gentleman witnessing the same incident. We stopped for lunch in the hope that water would be brought down the flight of locks by boats travelling in the opposite direction. Sure enough, after lunch all was well and we set off. By the time we arrived at our mooring for the night we were soaked to the skin. We each had a hot shower then put the radiators on to dry the clothes.</p>

<p>We spent the evening searching through the remaining storage space, still colonised by the previous owners stuff that we have inherited. We found 3 spare windlasses! Oh well.</p>

<p>Also we discovered loads of coal! That will start us off nicely this autumn.</p>
