<p>On Saturday we began the day with 3 hours of continuous locks... .great fun but we deserved our cup of tea by the time we moored up outside Birmingham Arena.</p>

<p>How sedate and calm the area seemed, perfect for spending a couple of nights.
By early evening the Arctic Monkeys fans were gathering outside the arena, all excited but well behaved. Soon after, the whole area was alive with revellers (that's the polite word for them). The noise - singing, shouting, screaming and bellowing into mobile phones - continued throughout the night and by the morning the towpath was covered in broken glass. Tony had to sweep up outside the boat before we could let Tarka off ... . Oh well, that was Saturday night, surely Sunday will be calmer. Oh no. Apparently the Brummies like to party ALL weekend. The boat next to us was set free by someone overnight on Sunday. When we went to bed they were moored in front of us. By the morning they had mysteriously moved and were tied to the window bars of the building opposite.</p>

<p>Whilst moored up we used the Canal & River Trust's facilities (toilets and shower) in preference to our own to save our water. This involves going armed to the teeth with tissues, anti-bac surface wipes and gel, as well as the obvious towel, soap and shampoo. Not forgetting the key to get in and a phone just in case something happens. I don't really know what that something is but I like to think my phone will be helpful if it should happen...</p>

<p>On the Monday we had a much anticipated visit from Julia, which was wonderful! She introduced us to her Birmingham which gave us an insight we would never have had otherwise. In the afternoon we all took Liberty Belle from her mooring to turn, pick up water, turn again and re-moor further along in Gas Street Basin. We look forward to her next visit.</p>

<p>Footnote - one of the Arctic Monkeys gave his shoes to a homeless gent, (Terry), outside Birmingham Arena. Sadly, Terry had his sleeping bag stolen by someone the following day.</p>
