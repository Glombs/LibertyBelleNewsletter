<p>Between us and Liverpool lay Burnley and Wigan, where we had been warned to expect trouble. So we set off early on another grey and windy Lancashire morning, hoping to get through the first of these obstacles before anyone noticed us, and maybe get some shopping on the way...</p>

<p>To get our supplies we hoped to pop into Morrisons which, according to Google Maps, was near to the canal and was due to open at 8 am.</p>

<p>We turned a corner and approached the bridge that we planned to moor next to for our shopping trip, steering to the right, towards the towpath.
Just as we did so, the supermarket came into view and we saw that it had its own mooring, but on the opposite side of the canal. As Tony quickly corrected the steering, another boat appeared from under the bridge heading towards us. Tony quickly jerked Liberty Belle over to the right again in order to allow the other boat to pass us on the correct side. All very tricky in the wind.</p>

<p>Poor Liberty Belle didn't know whether she was coming or going and we consequently got stuck aground. The helmsman on the other boat asked if we needed assistance as he passed by but we declined with thanks...</p>

<p>After getting properly afloat again we needed to reverse, in the wind, back around the corner and try to persuade Liberty Belle's bow to head for the supermarket mooring. After some fancy tiller work and a lot of luck, we tied up outside Morrisons only to be confronted by a locked gate....</p>

<p>I checked the supermarket opening times.</p>

<p>Yep, it should be open.</p>

<p>As the gate was at the back of the supermarket, maybe they had forgotten to open it...</p>

<p>Maybe they never open it...</p>

<p>I found their phone number and began to ring them.</p>

<p>No answer yet...</p>

<p>I suddenly had a thought. Maybe the gate can be opened with a boater's Waterways Facilities key or anti-vandal key, (usually used for locks and swing bridges).</p>

<p>I cut the phone call and we tried, with success!</p>

<p>Having got through the gate and re-locked it, (the anti-vandal locks can be a fiddle at the best of times) we realised we didn't have a trolley token or a pound coin on us. We couldn't be bothered to fight our way back through the gate again and so limited ourselves to a basket-full of shopping - one very heavy basket! It was enough though and we set off again as soon as we could.</p>

<p>The famous Burnley Straight Mile, a huge embankment built to carry the Leeds & Liverpool canal above Burnley, is thought to be one of the Seven Wonders of the British canal system. It was built to avoid a series of locks which would slow the canal traffic down. At the time it was an innovative solution to cutting down the travel time for the cargo boats.</p>

<p>Tony agrees that it is a wonder - a wonder we got across it... The water here is so shallow and full of weed and rubbish, we felt we were chewing our way along.</p>

<p>The propeller began to complain so we stopped and Tony cleared a pile of rubbish from around it before setting off again. Shortly afterwards the propeller again complained, this time there was a large sack, amongst other things, wrapped around the workings. Once that was cleared we tried again.</p>

<p>We did, in fact, stop in Burnley, but only for a brief look around. They have an interesting little museum in an old toll house, explaining the town's links with the textile industry and the canal.</p>

<p>One of the men working in the museum explained that Burnley did have a bad reputation amongst boaters but things were improving. Apparently, when Burnley has a festival in the town and lots of boaters want to moor there, he sleeps in the old toll house to keep an eye on the boats! In fact, he had seen someone staring into our boat and had investigated for us.</p>

<p>OK, thanks very much, enough said, off we go!</p>

<p>Beyond this section, all the way to Liverpool, we kept finding other parts of the canal in the same condition. It was frustratingly slow progress. It didn't help that we were doing these double locks on our own and it kept on raining.</p>

<p>Suddenly the engine cut out. Tony removed more rubbish from the propeller but this time something appeared to have been damaged.  Poor Liberty Belle now shudders and bumps as we are going along, as if we are driving over cobbles.</p>

<p>Eventually we arrived at a pound between two very close locks, where there were some boaters' facilities. In my wisdom (?) I decided to allow the next lock to fill up whilst we stopped to fill our water tank. </p>

<p>I nipped over and lifted one of the paddles to let the water drain in before coming back to help Tony manipulate the boat so that we could reach the very awkwardly positioned tap. It became apparent that one of our problems was Liberty Belle was getting grounded. The water in the pound seemed to be very low ... and getting lower...!</p>

<p>Oh no! Liberty Belle was grounded on one side and tipping...</p>

<p>I dashed back to the lock which was still trying to fill and failing because the water was passing straight through to the other side. The previous users had left a paddle open at the other end... we were rapidly emptying the pound! I dropped all the paddles and Tony dashed back to the previous lock to let water through that one too, down into the pound.</p>

<p>Liberty Belle gradually re-floated, so we stopped the flow of water from the lock above and all was well.</p>

<p>All this happened outside the Canal & River Trust office window....</p>

<p>After the panic was over and the rain had stopped, one of the volunteers emerged and helped us through the second lock...</p>

<p>After a night at Red Rock Bridge we set off early; too early to say good bye to next door's dogs... We had Wigan and its 25 locks to face, which would be open for boaters at 8:30 having been padlocked overnight.</p>

<p>We arrived to find two boats already queuing to go down the locks together.</p>

<p>We loitered, waiting for them to go before we slipped into position against the tow path, then I helped the two boats through the first lock. We were pleasantly surprised at the prettiness of the canal here.</p>

<p>The lock keeper popped over to another moored boat to ascertain whether they intended to go down the locks too. They were, so he paired us up.</p> 

<p>The lock keeper had a young man with him who seemed to know everyone. The woman I was locking with explained that he had been hanging around the locks for quite some time, helping the lock keepers. They had warmed to him and had managed to secure a Canal & River Trust apprenticeship for him. What a nice story.</p>

<p>It transpired that our locking companions had been living on their boat for 6 years. Her brother had been living in their house during this time but was now moving out. They couldn't afford to run both a house and a boat so didn't feel they had any option but to sell their boat and move back into the house. She wasn't sure how she was going to cope, living in a home that didn't move about.</p>

<p>Our locking partners stopped in Wigan after much discussion with the lock keeper on where to moor, but we needed to carry on...</p>

<p>When we arrived at the next lock we found a single-handed boater already leaving it. He was happy to wait for us to join him at the following lock, so we were soon partnered again. Single-handed boaters have to work very hard indeed to get through locks, so it is well worth their while to wait quite a long time for another boat to join them.</p>

<p>We were exhausted by the time we found our mooring at the other side of Wigan, outside a pub in a little village called Crooke. We deserved a pint! It turned out that we were moored in someone's private space but the landlady said they were away, so we were welcome.</p>

<p>After Crooke the canal was surprisingly pretty with some views and occasional sunshine (our first in Lancashire). We thought we might stop in Par-boiled (Parbold) which looked delightful with its canal side cafe & old windmill gallery. Unfortunately there was a fishing competition taking place along the tow path, occupying all of the visitor moorings, so we had to keep travelling to Burscough Bridge where we moored for a couple of nights.</p>

<p>(We now plan to stop at Par-boiled on our way back with Mary on board.)</p>

<p>We finally found Chorley Cakes in a supermarket in Burscough Bridge. Yay!</p>

<p>The Old Wharf area here has been nicely restored and has pleasant looking cafes and restaurants.</p> 

<p>After a rainy day in Burscough we woke up the next morning to sunshine and set off for Maghull, as close to Liverpool as we dared to go before nightfall.</p>

<p>We had moorings booked in the city on Weds 11th and were allowed to arrive sometime between 1 and 4 pm.
Between Maghull and Liverpool is a swing bridge which can only be operated outside rush hour (9:30am until 2 pm, then 6:30 pm until 7:30 am) to cause minimum disruption to road traffic. In order to time our arrival in Liverpool correctly we needed to leave our mooring in Maghull at 
8 am, go through the swing bridge at 9:30 and slide into Liverpool sometime in the afternoon.</p>

<p>All went well and we arrived at the swing bridge 5 minutes before we could operate it. Then, despite the shallowness of the canal reducing our speed so much that we thought we would never get there, we reached the top of the Liverpool Dock locks just as they were being opened. Unfortunately two boats were ahead of us so we had to wait, but not for long as there were 3 lock keepers in attendance, helping us all through.</p>

<p>The locks were padlocked again behind us.</p>

<p>Once at the entrance to the docks our route through to our mooring was complicated, weaving from dock to dock through various narrow gaps! We had a map, verbal instructions and a lock keeper meeting us at the last lock... Luckily it all went well.</p>

<p>It was exciting getting glimpses of the Liver Birds and then suddenly arriving right outside the building! After several bridges and tunnels, one of them under the new museum, we finally passed through Albert Dock into Salthouse Dock where we managed to moor in our allocated space, despite the wind.</p>

<p>I could hardly believe we were finally here!</p>

<h2>Where Next?</h2>

<p>This newsletter has been a long time coming!</p>

<p>We are now on our way to Wales on the LLangollen Canal.</p>

<p>We expect to come back via Nantwich (LIberty Belle's 'home town'), then through Wolverhampton and Birmingham to Leamington Spa.</p>

<p>From there we plan to get a train back to the house to get a few jobs done. (Robin says the weeds are taking over!)</p>
