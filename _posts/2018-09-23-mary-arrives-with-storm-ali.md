<p>On the Tuesday we spent the morning visiting the launderette and Tesco. Later we collected Mary from the amazing and baffling New Street Station. We dined on the boat then showed Mary the Cathedral and the Damascena coffee house, followed by the delights of the Canal and River Trust facilities....</p>
<p>In Damascena, Mum had a cup of tea, I had a cardamom tea and Tony had this.... A spiced 'coffee' (no coffee was in evidence but the hot liquid was delicious), served with dates and a tahini dip. Tony wasn't too sure about the dates and dip but I found it a revelation! This will be my new go-to snack!</p>

<p>On Wednesday we set off towards Stratford. First we wanted to collect water but the strong wind, made all the stronger from being funnelled between two high buildings, wouldn't allow us to draw in by the tap, so we were forced onwards in the hope of finding another at some later point...</p>

<p>Progress was slow due to wind, rain, low water levels and something wrapped around the propeller. We pulled over and Tony released the propeller from the bits of rope, cloth and twigs that Liberty Belle had been collecting on her travels. This helped a bit...</p>

<p>We did eventually find water then moored up just before the evening started to draw in.</p>
