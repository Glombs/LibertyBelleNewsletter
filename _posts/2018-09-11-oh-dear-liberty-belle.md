<p>At the weekend, Robin and Ben took control of Liberty Belle whilst Tony and I were away in Bristol. They left first thing in the morning and set off in the boat after a Wetherspoons breakfast (of course!) in Coventry.</p>

<p>I am sorry to say that Liberty Belle played them up and slipped one of her jubilee clips. The engine bay was filled with steam. Oh dear, Liberty Belle, not quite the relaxing weekend Robin was hoping for... Luckily Robin had the know-how and, after locating the tool box, managed to get her under control.</p>

<p> Despite this early set back, Robin and Ben managed to get all the way to Nuneaton by 5pm on Saturday, where they turned and moored just beyond the stop lock at Hawkesbury Junction for the night. I think it had something to do with the close proximity of the Greyhound Pub...</p>

<p>They certainly made good use of it for beer in the evening and a sustaining breakfast on Sunday morning, (containing a 12 inch sausage, apparently), before setting off again for the Coventry Canal Basin. There they left Liberty Belle, (fully stocked with beer and cake), for us to collect on Sunday evening.</p>
