<p>The next morning, on our own again after our visitors have gone, we brave the supermarket to replenish our supplies. Later, I stayed on the boat nursing my sore foot and Tony went off to explore Rugby.</p>

<p>After lunch we started on our gentle journey towards Coventry where Tony and Tarka are hoping to catch a train back to the house on Sunday.</p>

<p>No locks to do on the way, just a gentle meander, admiring the boats we pass and the countryside around us. Hawthorn berries, rosehips, blackberries and sloes. Ash trees heavy with their seeds hanging over the water. Swallows darting about. Moorhens, ducks and swans with their offspring almost fully grown. A kingfisher hovering in front of our boat! Beautiful!</p>

<p>A stop off at sunny Brinklow where we visited the church, admiring the tiny peacock depicted in one of the church windows and the steep angle of the floor; the Motte and Bailey castle (remains of); the local deli/cafe where we were filled almost to the top (Brink-low!?) with a large pot of Earl Grey for me and a latte for Tony (hot and decent, apparently).</p>

<p>An overnight stop at Ansty. We visit the churchyard with Commonwealth wargraves of RAF pilots and instructors presumably involved in an incident above Ansty in April 1941.</p>

<p>Some died on the day, others weeks or a month or two later, presumably of their injuries. Sad times. The graves are well kept and adorned with poppies.</p>

<p>Eventually we joined the Coventry canal. Sadly, as we got nearer the city there was a build up of rubbish in the canal and along the tow path. On the plus side there were also patches of water lilies and buddleia plants - past their best now but still making an effort.</p>

<p>Oddly, on regular occasions, we saw a coconut floating by.... I appeal to anyone out there who is supplying coconuts to Coventry - please don't send any more, they are not eating them.</p>

<p>The rubbish and graffiti made the towpath look rather unwelcoming so we chose our lunch stop carefully and shut ourselves in. It was probably very safe really but we didn't want to take any silly chances...</p>

<p>By the end of the day we had found a mooring spot just before the Coventry Canal Basin, next to a  Halfords carpark and opposite a new housing estate, where we spent the night.</p>
