<p>Dear All,</p>
<p>we have bought our narrowboat! Her name is Liberty Belle and she is currently in Crick marina, having a few things fixed before we can set off on our adventure.</p>

<p>For those of you who are unaware, Tony and I have decided to live on board a narrowboat for a year or two, travelling the canal system. We are very excited!</p>

<p>Tony first saw Liberty Belle back in May. In July we went on a trip to visit various boatyards and were surprised to find her still for sale. Generally speaking, narrow boats seem to be selling very quickly - we would get notifications of boats coming up for sale and before we could view the ones we liked, they would be sold. So, we had a survey done on Liberty Belle and she was generally sound. We had her hull blacked and booked her in to have a few other jobs done that had been highlighted in the survey. Meanwhile Tony has organised the insurance and licence (a frustrating job).</p>

<p>So here we are - packed (sort of) and ready (ish..) As soon as we get the go-ahead, we will be off.</p>

<p>We will return to the house at various times for various reasons so will catch up with people here when we can. If you live elsewhere in the country, we may be heading towards you! (Very slowly though, so there is time to get out of the way...)</p>

<p>In the meantime I will periodically be sending these newsletters using MailChimp. Don't feel obliged to answer them or even acknowledge them and Please Please feel free to unsubscribe at any time (there should be a button at the bottom I believe...). If you want to get in touch, please do so using the usual methods - we will be checking our emails when we can and receiving text messages wherever there is a signal.</p>

<p>Lots of love from Tony, Rachel and Tarka</p>
