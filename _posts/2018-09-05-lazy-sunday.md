<h2>Coventry</h2>
<h2>2nd September 2018</h2>

<p>After another Wetherspoons breakfast, (somehow the shopping got forgotten the day before so we didn't have much in!), it was decided that we should take it easy. We planned to go for a drive in Robin's car as both Robin and I had sore feet. On the way back to the canal Tony and Robin tried and failed to buy a new padlock for Liberty Belle's back door. Oh well.</p>

<p>Before we set off we met two Canadians just setting off to cycle the Oxford Canal Walk, the start of which is the Coventry Canal Basin. We gave lots of advice, some of which might even have been welcome! We also insisted they had a tour of the boat. We all set off much later than planned.</p>

<p>Robin drove us to Hawkesbury junction, where the Oxford Canal joins the Coventry Canal. We had spotted a lovely looking pub there called The Greyhound. We were not disappointed, it was indeed a very friendly, interesting and cosy pub. (The Canadians we met earlier also turned up there for lunch.)</p>

<p>Here we finalised the details of the plan for Robin and his friend Ben to borrow Liberty Belle over the next weekend (the weather and Robin's foot injury permitting).
Tony and I are to travel by train from Coventry on Friday to visit Bristol and catch up with Cathy, Will, Joe, John and Melissa, returning on Sunday. Meanwhile Robin and Ben will take the boat up to Hawkesbury Junction for the night, visiting The Greyhound for a pint or two. Then, on Sunday, bringing her back for us to collect at Coventry for the next leg of our journey...</p>

<p>We returned to Liberty Belle just in time to meet the Canadians on their way back! Fate.</p>

<p>Robin, Tony and Tarka left in the late afternoon, loaded up with the old mattress, the previous owners collection of bedding and a rucksack full of washing.</p>

<p>I spent the evening writing up these notes and watching two men having a lot of trouble with a small boat. The engine kept stopping and the boat was drifting about from the bushes on one side of the canal to the tow path on the other (precariously close to Liberty Belle). Some passing characters (for want of a better word) yelled some helpful stuff and tried to persuade the drifting boaters to throw a rope their way. This was tried but the rope was tangled and not tied to the boat.... Meanwhile, the pint glass, half full of lager, balanced on the gunwales remained stubbornly in place. Eventually a man in a canoe took them in hand and they were tied up at the water tap in front of us. I felt a little guilty not offering any assistance but decided I might make things worse and get the blame for the whole thing!</p>
