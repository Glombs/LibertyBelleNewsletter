<p>Joe and Kirsty joined us late on the Friday night. On Saturday Joe treated us to a slap-up breakfast in Stratford then we set off back up the Stratford Canal towards Warwick.
Having extra crew members with lots of enthusiasm, we made good time and on Sunday we were outside the Fleur de Lys in Lowsonford in time for lunch. How fortuitous!

<p>Joe and Kirsty headed back and we stayed where we were moored for the night.</p>

<p>Off the next day to Kingswood Junction to join the wide Grand Onion (oh, OK, Union) Canal. On Tuesday we broke our record for the number of locks in one day, completing 23 over a distance of 3.5 miles. Go us!</p>

<p>To tell the truth we had a lot of help from Canal & River Trust volunteers and staff which were there in force! There was a lack of water in the locks and we became temporarily grounded. They reassured us that they would get us afloat and emptied water down the locks until we were able to move again. I wouldn't have had the nerve to do that, at least not without a lot of hesitation and time wasting.

<p>We moored up just outside Warwick and had a wander around to see some of its historic buildings. It was too late in the day to go inside Warwick castle but we did use their loos - very nice and, thankfully, not too historic.</p>

<p>The next day, on our way to Leamington Spa, we stopped directly outside Lidl and topped up on a few store cupboard groceries. Mary had an encounter with a very large poster which an employee had left lying on the floor. She stepped onto it, it slipped and sent her sliding. She stopped herself against the packing shelf.... The employee simply said Didn't you see it?'.</p>
<p>Bloomin' 'eck! Mary was very lucky that she didn't end up badly injured. Stupid man.</p>

<p>We spent the rest of the day exploring Leamington Spa and Mary treated us to lunch in Zizzi's - very nice indeed!
