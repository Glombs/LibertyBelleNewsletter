<p>We left Woolhampton full of trepidation, wondering what the Kennet and Avon would throw at us next. It turned out to be a confused electronically operated swing bridge. Having waited for the pedestrians on the towpath to cross over the bridge, I pressed the appropriate buttons to lower the barriers and start the swinging process. Before it had opened enough to let Liberty Belle go through, it stopped. According to a passer-by, it had been fixed the day before... By now, more pedestrians were gathering on the towpath, waiting to cross and Tony was wondering what was taking so long. I pressed the button required to swing the bridge back across the canal and there was some movement, which was encouraging. Tony tied Liberty Belle up and came to investigate. I allowed the bridge to shut again and re-started the process. This time the bridge behaved exactly as it should, opening wide to allow Tony to guide Liberty Belle through. It also closed perfectly and we were off again. Phew.</p>

<p>We passed through Newbury, where we should have been moored back in February for my Mum's birthday - just a bit late. There, we teamed up with another boat, a hire boat with a crew of 10, covering 3 generations of a family, and worked the locks together. We had a short delay, (OK, a long delay), when one of their crew threw the rope from the boat in the direction of a waiting crew member on the tow path, and the rope fell in the water. There was a terrible sound as the rope wrapped itself many, many times around the propeller.  Liberty Belle was waiting in the lock for the other boat to join her. After a while, two more boats arrived and tied up patiently. Just as we were about to give the lock to these newcomers there was a cheer and the offending rope was held aloft. We were off!</p>

<p>At Kintbury we managed to squeeze into the last available mooring. It could have been argued that we were partially blocking the bridge so we planned an early start.</p>

<p>We managed to set off before anyone had time to complain about our mooring. Entering a lock we noticed a boat following behind us so we waited for them to catch up. A young man, jogging along the towpath, stopped to help at the lock by opening the second gate. I thanked him. I was a little surprised that he should stop his jog for us. He explained that he was holidaying on the approaching boat and was a little put out that they had set off whilst he was on his run....</p>

<p>There appeared to be two other young people on the boat but as we all waited for the lock to fill, several more young people gradually emerged, buttoning up their clothes, or eating cereal, or cleaning their teeth…. Obviously two of the crew were much too impatient to wait for the others to be ready. We shared the locks with them until they turned around just before Hungerford.</p>

<p>After lunch and a quick look around the town we teamed up with another boat, 'First Light', owned by Colin and Julie who are on the same adventure as us! This is the first couple we have met that are continuous cruisers planning to complete the whole network. Obviously we had a lot to chat about. Our first encounter together was a collapsed swing bridge, crawling with Canal & River Trust people rapidly repairing it.</p>

<p>Suddenly, out of nowhere, Beckie and Buddy appeared! It was an amazing surprise. They were able to join us on board for a little while until we arrived at the bridge where Beckie had left her car.</p>

<p>At Great Bedwyn, First Light moored up and we said goodbye to Colin & Julie. We continued on to our mooring for the night, alongside a field of delightful pigs who ignored us completely. I briefly thought we had a very different neighbour in another field - a large kind of deer or elk. I was very excited! However, when it lifted it’s head, its antlers remained on the floor, now looking like a fallen branch. The strange creature was a donkey. I do like donkeys but it was still a bit of a disappointment.</p>

<p>After checking on the pigs, (fast asleep in a bundled heap in their cosy house), we set off through 10 locks and a tunnel. The tunnel was short and we were able to see a heron framed in the circle made by the far end of the tunnel and it’s reflection. It was a beautiful sight, gradually becoming closer and closer. Just as we were about to emerge from the tunnel I tried to take a photo of the heron but, of course, it flew away.</p>

<p>We arrived at Honeystreet and were able to moor up directly outside the Barge Inn. The perfect mooring! I have always wanted to moor there. Unfortunately the pub was closed for refurbishment. No wonder the mooring was available. Hmm.</p>

<p>Robin joined us there and, to make up for our disappointment at finding the pub closed, he drove us to another pub and bought us dinner. What made it even more delightful was the pub parrot. He didn’t speak to us at all on the way in, but as we left he clearly said</p>

<p>“Goodbye. Thankyou.”</p>
<p>Fabulous!</p>

<p>The following morning we waited in Honeystreet for the Devizes to Westminster canoe race to pass by. We had no desire to get muddled up in that. Whilst we waited we all got some jobs done. Once it was clear, Robin drove off to park his car in Devizes and we set off in Liberty Belle. Robin cycled back along the towpath and met us at a swing bridge where he and his bike boarded Liberty Belle and we arrived in Devizes together where we met up with the Bradshaws and Julie.</p>

<p>With Julie & Robin as extra crew members we flew down the Caen Hill locks, fuelled by ice cream, tea & biscuits and lager, in that order. After a well deserved lunch, Robin and Julie each went on their way. We sat in the shade on the towpath and enjoyed a relaxing cuppa. Later Joe joined us on his way home from a road trip to Scotland and the Lakes.</p>

<p>The next morning Joe crewed with us for a while before returning to his van and heading home. We continued on to Bradford-on-Avon, where we shared the last lock with a hire boat. The boat was a long one and the stern of the boat was subjected to a lot of water spray whilst in the lock. Tony felt sorry for the woman at the helm and let her out of the lock first, despite the concern that she might take the best mooring space! Fortunately, her boat was too long to fit into the space we wanted.</p>

<p>On a stroll around Bradford-on-Avon we bumped into a woman from the boat we shared the Caen Hill locks with the day before, which was nice.</p>

<p>After a short stay in the delightful Bradford-on-Avon we set off for Bath. The countryside was beautiful. There were lots of boats to see on the way, in varying states of repair (or dis-repair). We moored on the outskirts of Bath, just before Sydney gardens then went for a stroll to see if there were any other moorings available nearer the railway station. We were due to meet Mary off her train the next day. Having found what we wanted, we had a quick look around Bath and decided we like it.</p>
