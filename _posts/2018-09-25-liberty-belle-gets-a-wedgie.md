<p>We are now travelling along the Stratford canal which just gets prettier and prettier. The weather has kept us guessing, with a mixture of rain, heavy rain, wind, strong wind and sunshine.</p>

<p>On Friday we discovered a fabulous bakery/cafe/deli just yards from the canal. There were so many delicious looking goodies on display that we decided to sit down in the cafe and have a hot drink whilst we discussed what to buy. We finally purchased a large pork pie, 6 sausages, a large loaf of cheesy bread and 3 fresh cream chocolate eclairs - the biggest ever seen!</p>

<p>Further down the canal we managed to defy the wind and pull into a boatyard for elsan, water and a new mooring chain. It was a close thing.</p>

<p>Later, Mum decided to grab a windlass and help with the locks. She found it impossible to shift the lock gate paddle. I moved in to show how it's done and couldn't move it either! After swinging on it and putting all my weight behind it, we had success. This was the first of some very stiff paddles.</p>

<p>On Saturday we had locks galore. On leaving one of them we found Liberty Belle was stuck fast. Tony couldn't move her either backwards or forwards. One of the rope fenders was wedged in between the lock gate and the side of the boat. On the other side, another fender was squashed hard against the lock wall. After trying to move using the engine, Tony went to the bow and stretched around the side to try and loosen the fenders. He managed to untie one of them and passed the end of its rope to me so that I could prevent it from being lost in the lock and potentially getting caught in the propeller or the lock gate. It was still firmly stuck. Tony employed the boat hook to try to loosen the other fender, bashing it downwards towards a narrower part of the hull (cleaning the inside of the lock with his coat at the same time...). This gave the inch that Liberty Belle needed and Tony managed to reverse her out of trouble, releasing the rope fender which I hauled out of the way. Forwards now and we were off! The whole situation was made more stressful by Tarka being loose at the lock, trying to lean over and see what was going on, whilst a German Shepherd puppy was annoying her; a friendly woman ineffectually holding back said German Shepherd whilst asking inane questions; the woman's four children enjoying the whole situation and finally, another boat turning up hoping to use the lock we were stuck in.....</p>

<p>Chicken casserole, red wine and a coal fire helped to cheer us all up! (Tarka declined the wine.)</p>

<p>Sunday began with more rain. We braved the weather though to get 6 locks completed so that we could keep our rendezvous with Julia and a Sunday roast in a canalside pub. The sun broke out, the food was lovely and plentiful, the beer was good and the company was perfect. Just what we all needed.</p>

<p>Tony managed to get the fire going using the embers from the night before. We moved on. The fire continued for the rest of day and we were able to bring it back to life again the following day. With the fire going we had to remove the chimney now and again for the lowest bridges.</p>

<p>As we progressed along the canal we saw several lock keeper's cottages with distinctive domed roofs that reflect the shape of the bridges carrying the roads across the canal. They are called barrel-shaped roofs, apparently. Also very distinctive are the iron, black and white footbridges that take the towpath from one side of the canal to the other. They are split in half, with a gap for the horses' ropes to pass through. Cunning!
