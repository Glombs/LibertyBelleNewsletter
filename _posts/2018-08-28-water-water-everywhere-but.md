<p>I got up early and resumed the cleaning and putting away. When I tired of that, Tarka and I walked down to Norton Junction and back before the rain set in, had a bit of lunch then re-resumed the job in hand. An annoying noise, assumed to be a nearby boat's engine, turned out to be the water pump announcing the lack of water in our tank. Pump switched off, bottles in one hand, umbrella in the other I paddled off to fetch some drinking water from the tap at the locks...<p>

<p>Tony returned in the afternoon bringing cake and damsons!

<p>Sadly it was too late for us to go down the locks, so a second night by the motorway. Tony agreed with me about the mattress...</p>
