<h2>Halifax</h2>
<h2>7th August 2019</h2>

<p>Whilst we were moored in Sowerby Bridge, we were so close to Halifax that we decided to go there for the day and explore. To save our feet for the tourist trail, we opted for the short train ride rather than the steep climb.</p>

<p>Our day was full of historical interest. It began by crossing over an interesting cobbled iron footbridge on our way to Sowerby Bridge railway station. Once at the station we had numerous information boards detailing the histories of local people and buildings to keep us amused whilst waiting for our train.</p>

<p>In Halifax itself there are so many interesting places to visit that we were spoilt for choice.</p>

<p>The beautiful old Halifax railway station building has been replaced by a smaller, modern building. It is now part of the 'Eureka!' complex, the National Children's Museum, which all looks very exciting.</p>

<p>On the front of the old building is a depiction of John the Baptist carved in stone. More of him later...</p>

<p>The Halifax Minster is dedicated to St. John the Baptist (of course).</p>

<p>(Inside we could have paid Â£3 for a licence to take photos but we were too mean...)</p>

<p>The magnificent wooden ceiling is divided into squares, each one with a coat of arms painted within it. Each of the pews has a little entry gate. I studied these in the hope of finding some indication of individual families having marked them as their own but was disappointed. However, I then found, at the back of the minster, a display of brass plaques which had been removed from the pews, each one with the name of an individual, family or organisation. A few were dated, the oldest being 1699.</p>

<p>Tony was impressed by the memorial of an Archbishop of Dublin who specified in his will that his heart and bowels should be interred in the Halifax Minster, whilst the rest of his remains went elsewhere. He has decided that his own will is not nearly complicated enough...</p>

<p>The Piece Hall was a welcome refuge for us from the rain. This amazing building, consisting of a sloping square surrounded by individual rooms on 3 floors, was originally built in the 1700's as a market place for cloth. Halifax was famous for its wool cloth. It was woven by local people into 'pieces' 30 yards long and the width of a standard loom. Each 'piece' took one weaver a whole week to produce.</p>

<p>Each salesman had one of the 315 rooms in the Piece Hall from which he would sell his weavers' 'pieces' from 10-12 on Saturday mornings. This short window in which to purchase the cloth helped to keep the prices high. (Besides, the rest of the week was needed to produce more 'pieces'...)</p>

<p>The building was only used for it's original purpose for 40 years because the large industrial mills took over from the individual spinners and weavers.</p>

<p>Now the Piece Hall has interesting shops and cafes as well as a museum. It's square is the venue for concerts, markets and art installations. It is well worth a visit.</p>

<p>Halifax's elaborate Town Hall was designed by the same man, (Charles Barry), who designed The Houses of Parliament. Even the fabulous exterior cannot prepare you for the extravagant design of its central Victoria Hall which takes your breath away.</p>

<p>One thing that became apparent was that Halifax is obsessed with St. John the Baptist who's head, according to local legend, was buried here. His 'likeness' crops up everywhere (often with dripping blood detail) but especially in the Town Hall.</p>

<p>As well as their favourite saint, the Town Hall also likes to incorporate their town's initial letter in the decoration.</p>

<p>We had a quick look around the indoor market which appears to be thriving. The stalls themselves were no more remarkable than in other towns but the building which houses them is beautiful with elaborate entry gates, a central clock, glass ceiling and red dragons!</p>

<p>Dean Clough Mill is enormous but a fraction of its original size. It used to be the worlds largest carpet mill but is now a centre for business and the arts. It houses art galleries, which we didn't have time to do justice to, as well as a small theatre.</p>

<p>Thank you Halifax, we had a great day out. We didn't have time to see everything of interest so Tony and I certainly intend to return.</p>

<p>The perfect end to the perfect day was our meal in the very popular Syhiba Restaurant back in Sowerby Bridge. We had the biggest Naan I have ever seen.</p>

<p>On our way back to the boat we passed the Loose Goose Inn, outside of which were loads of geese, taking up half of the road.  How appropriate!</p>
