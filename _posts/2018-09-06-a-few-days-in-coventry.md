<h2>A few days in Coventry</h2>
<h2>3rd-6th September 2018</h2>

<p>For the next few days I wandered from Wetherspoons (free WiFi, tea refills and loos) to IKEA (free Wifi, tea refills, loos and electricity for the laptop - not to mention cinnamon buns 60p each). In this way I have managed to write and send my Newsletter, catch up with emails, do a bit of shopping, do some people watching and in the meantime I am keeping use of the toilet cassette to a minimum.</p>

<p>It has surprised me how many of the same people are in IKEA's restaurant day after day (obviously, I am one of them..)</p>

<p>I have done a bit of housework in the boat, of course, and a bit of forward planning with regard to our next bit of travelling.</p>

<p>It was perfect drying weather on Monday and Wednesday so I did a bit of washing.  Washing clothes is a bit 'back to basics'. I don't bash anything on any rocks - not that basic. It involves me putting clothes, hot water and liquid soap in a trug bucket within the shower tray and treading the clothes with my feet! Great fun! Then I hang a radiator clothes airer on the shower curtain rail and allow the clothes to drip over the shower tray. Once the dripping is over, this can then be transferred to the doors at the back of the boat. Once dryish they can hang on the radiator indoors then get transferred from the airer to my tiny airing cupboard! It works - really!</p>

<p>On Tuesday I washed the carpet (a hands-and -knees job). Then later I got out the Brasso! I had great ambitions of making Liberty Belle's mushroom vents shine! I set to on the first one. 20 minutes and quite a lot of Brasso later, there was very little difference made... Oh well.</p>

<p>On Wednesday I set off to find the railway station. The layout of Coventry is still a bit of a mystery to me. It's an odd place. Having been bombed in 1940 much of it had to be rebuilt.</p>

<p>Some of the city, saved from the 1940 bombing, has a Winchester feel to it.
The old, bombed out Cathedral and it's shockingly modern replacement are reminiscent of Berlin, as is the wide pedestrian/cycle path on the approach to the modern railway station.
Cuddled up to the Cathedral are the very modern Coventry University buildings.
In Spon Street, where salvaged medieval buildings have been re-erected, it is hard to ignore the massive IKEA bearing down on it.</p>

<p>The Canal Basin has undergone regeneration in the past and must have looked lovely but it has since become rather run down and sad looking.
Some little pockets of the city have been pedestrianised with lovely flowers and seating areas, even the odd tree, but the rest of the city reminds me very much of Basildon. Sorry Basildon.

<p>I won't be sad to leave Coventry. I'm not a city person. Nothing untoward happened but I felt, constantly, as if it might!</p>
<p>We're off to Bristol tomorrow to spend a couple of days with family. Back on the water on Sunday.</p>
