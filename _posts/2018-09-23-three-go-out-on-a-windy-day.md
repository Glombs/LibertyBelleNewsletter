Let's go for a walk to the craft village!

Goodbye to Tarka - bye, bye, bye

Along the towpath - stomp, stomp, stomp

Over the bridge - trip trap, trip trap

Into single file - one, two, three

Along the scary road - whoosh, whoosh, whoosh

Through the howling wind - woooo, woooo, woooo

Past the rotting deer - poo, poo, stink

Past the nosey goats - hi, hi, hi!

Past the alligator teeth - tip toe, tip toe

Through the car park - an-tici-pation...

Into the craft village - closed, closed, closed....

Ah! Into the button shop - one, two, three

Exit with nothing - one, two three,

Into the tea shop - service please! Please?

Tea for three - slurp, slurp, slurp

Queue for the loo - one, two, three
 

Back through the car park - who owns all these cars....?

Past the alligator teeth - tip toe, tip toe

Past the nosey goats - hi, hi, hi!

Into single file - one, two, three

Along the scary road - whoosh, whoosh, whoosh

Through the howling wind - woooo, woooo, woooo

Past the rotting deer - poo, poo, stink

Over the bridge - trip trap, trip trap

Along the towpath - stomp, stomp, stomp

Into the boat - yay, yay, yay

Hello Tarka - wag, wag, wag

Wipe our feet - shuffle, shuffle, shuffle

Sit down - one, two, three

We're not going to be tempted by a craft village again!
