<p>And we're off!! We filled Liberty Belle's water tank at the locks and were escorted down by the volunteer lock keepers. Whilst helping with the lock paddles I noticed there were two sets per lock, one pair painted red, the other painted white. I took an executive decision and opened the white one first... Apparently, according to the lock keeper, the saying goes "Red before white, you'll be alright. White before red, you'll wish you were dead." Ah!</p>

<p>Anyway, no harm done. This time.</p>

<p>Then off to the junction. We moored up for a while and visited a little canalside shop which was an Aladdin's cave of canalware! How much would Tony let me spend?? Oh, nothing...</p>

<p>We then attempted our first double lock. We were on our own so lots of room but the gates were very heavy and the paddles stiff. I was managing but suddenly there was whistling, shouting, gesticulating and lots of loud mis-communication. Poor Liberty Belle had her rear tucked on the cill and her nose was inches from going under. Tony blamed tiredness from a bad night, too large a lock which he felt was large enough to avoid any danger and Tarka being her usual pain in the ... Unfortunately there were witnesses in the lockside pub garden.</p>

<p>After what seemed like a painfully long time of trying to refill the lock, and just a little bit (?) of panic, palpitations and wondering what the insurance company would say, she was afloat again. Wow!</p>

<p>With our nerves jangling we continued on our way, doing seven locks altogether. We finally moored up at Weedon Bridge at 7 p.m. We couldn't face shopping then cooking before we could eat, and besides we really fancied a beer! In the end we had a delicious curry at the local Indian restaurant and took home a doggy bag for tomorrow's lunch.</p>

<p>When we got back we put our memory foam mattress topper over the original mattress and had a comfortable night.</p>

<p>What with the curry, the beer and the change in Tarka's diet, I now could appreciate the ventilation. In fact we could probably have done with a little more!</p>
