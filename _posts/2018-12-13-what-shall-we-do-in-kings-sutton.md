<h2>Kings Sutton</h2>
<h2>8th December 2018</h2>

<xmp>
We're going on a beer hunt,

We're going to find some real ale,

What a miserable day....

We're not fazed!
 

Lock up the boat,

Clickerty clack click.

Through the howling wind,

Wooo, woooo, wooooo...

Along the muddy towpath,

Squelch, squelch, squelch.

Onto the busy road,

Careful, careful, mind us!

Over the hump-back bridge,

Trip trap, trip trap.

Over the tall style,

Steady, steady, whoa!

Through the water-logged field,

Splishy splashy, splishy splashy.

Over the railway track,

Danger! Danger! Danger!

Over the wooden bridge,

Trip trap, trip trap.

Through the indifferent Pony's field,

Hi! Hi! (No response).

Through the new housing estate,

Very posh, nice, smart.

Up the steep hill,

Stomp, stomp, stomp.

Through the very tall church,

Wow, wow, ooooo!

Across the village green,

Quick, it's raining!
 

Into the pub,

Two pints please,

Don't forget to use the facilities....

Listen to the locals,

While they chomp on their roast goose.

"...the Audi or Mercedes?"

"You'll need your morning suit..."
 

Back through the pub door,

Oooo, sunny day!

Back through the village,

This isn't the way we cameâ€¦

Back down the hill,

Stomp, stomp, stomp,

Back through the housing estate,

Very posh, nice, smart.

Back through the Pony's field,

Hi! (still no response).

Back over the wooden bridge,

Trip trap, trip trap.

Back over the railway track,

Danger! Danger! Danger!

Back through the water-logged field,

Splishy splashy, splishy splashy.

Back over the tall style,

Steady, steady, whoa!

Back over the hump-back bridge,

Trip trap, trip trap.

Back onto the busy road,

Careful, careful, mind us!

Back along the muddy towpath,

Squelch, squelch, squelch.

Back through the howling wind,

Wooo, woooo, wooooo....

Unlock up the boat,

Clickerty clack click.
 

Into the boat,

Shoes off please

Don't forget to brew some tea.

We're NEVER going on a beer hunt again!

(Huh?)
