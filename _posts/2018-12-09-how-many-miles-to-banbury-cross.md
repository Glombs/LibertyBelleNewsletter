<h2>Cropredy to Banbury</h2>
<h2>15th-21st November 2018</h2>

<p>Fieldfares had been our constant companions in the Napton area, dashing about from field to hedge and back again each one trying to out-busy the other, but they have become few and far between since we moved on. At Cropredy we had a flock of starlings to entertain us, their favourite perch being the church tower.</p>

<p>We stayed on at Cropredy after the solar panels had been installed, but moved to a 14 day mooring a little further down the canal. We read the church guide at our leisure then re-visited it. Having done our homework first it was a more satisfying experience, although we have probably forgotten most of it already!

<p>Leaving Tarka in charge of the boat, Tony, My Foot and I walked from Cropredy to Banbury. The walk there was delightful but my foot complained most of the way back so I was forced to take lots of rest breaks. Oh well, nice try!</p>

<p>Despite our new solar panels the fridge has continued to struggle. Confusingly the voltage of the battery is plenty high enough but by the time it reaches the middle of the boat it is considerably lower. Solve one problem and it reveals another - Tony is investigating...</p>

<p>Off then to Banbury, taking Liberty Belle and Tarka with us this time. We needed to travel beyond a section of the canal that was due is to be drained and repaired.

<p>Moored up just outside Banbury we found ourselves alongside a very pleasant public park and within easy reach of Waitrose, Aldi, Dunelm, B&Q and other delights in the industrial estate just over the footbridge. Retail therapy brought many things including rugs, warm gloves and groceries as well as padlocks and chain to secure our new solar panels...</p>

<p>Tony thought he was onto a winner with the chain. He found the chain he wanted at £3.20 a metre, took 2.5 metres to the till and the cashier asked him for £3.20; Tony explained that it was priced per metre and he had 2.5 metres but joked that he was happy to pay £3.20. The cashier thanked Tony, saying that would be the easiest thing to do and took £3.20 in payment....</p>

<p>Tony's delight was short lived; after dividing the chain into 3 sections, one for each solar panel and widening the end links to accept the padlocks, the chain was too short.....</p>

<p>Meanwhile we watched the draining of the canal ready for the repairs. It was fascinating.</p>

<p>We moved Liberty Belle closer to the centre of Banbury to a 14 day mooring outside the shopping centre where we could safely leave her whilst we went back to the house in order to receive our long awaited new garage doors. All packed, we walked the short distance to the railway station. Having wrestled 2 rucksacks, a large bag on wheels, us and Tarka to the correct platform we were told our train had been replaced by a bus which we could catch if we were quick enough... Back we went. The coach driver took one look at Tarka and refused to allow us to board. Back we went. A kind railway employee took up our cause but to no avail so a taxi was hailed and off we went to Oxford station. Tarka was visibly confused as she knows a treat is always in store when travelling by train and now she was in a car..... odd.</p>

<p>More confusion as our intended train was cancelled. Time for a coffee and a re-think. Tarka had a treat too. It wasn't on a train but she wasn't about to argue.</p>

<p>At Reading station we struggled down the escalator to the correct platform only to have the platform changed at the last minute. Back up the escalator and down another to the new platform.... Picture Tarka being carried by me on each escalator ride, looking all the world like she travels like this every day, one paw casually resting on the moving handrail...</p>

<p>Finally we made it back to the house, little knowing what the next few days would bring.</p>
