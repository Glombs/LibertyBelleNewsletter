 <p>The return to narrow canals!</p>
 </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>We arrived back in Stratford-upon-Avon, Tony took back the hire car and, after a bit of lunch, we set off along the Stratford Canal to get a few locks done before the end of the day. Rivers are very exciting but being back on a narrow canal felt good. We had travelled this way two years before but I had forgotten how pretty the Stratford Canal is with its neat little bridges, aqueducts and cottages with barrel shaped roofs. These cottages were built using the same techniques as the bridges, possibly by the same people using the original wooden forms. Cunning.</p>

<p>At one of the locks a group of teenage lads took quite an interest in us, asking all sorts of questions about the canal boating life, then wishing us well as we left. We meet a lot of interested people as we potter around the canals but usually they are people our own age or older, or young children, so this made a refreshing change.</p>

<p>We spent the next day cruising all the way to Lowsonford's Fleur de Lys pub, 9 miles and 20 locks away. Tony introduced an added incentive by booking us a table there for Sunday lunch the following day. Having shared the driving and locking duties between us, we arrived in plenty of time for a relaxing beer in the garden before the afternoon was over.</p>

<p>Having enjoyed our delicious lunch (in very covid-aware surroundings), we set off again for Kingswood junction. As we passed under the oak trees lining the canal we were bombarded with acorns, it was quite violent!</p>

<p>After Kingswood we were on the increasingly busy North Stratford Canal and hoped to complete 23 locks on the first day. We were lucky enough to have some help from the Canal & River Trust volunteers, one of whom escorted us up the main Lapworth Flight, forging ahead to set each lock, so the going was easy.</p>

<p>During the day I observed a technique for opening the double lock gates which I couldn't help trying for myself. It didn't only save time and energy but was great fun too, so I was rather pleased with it.</p>

<p>We arrived at our destination in Lapworth by lunch time!</p>

<p>Our plan was to get to Birmingham where we had arranged to meet up with Julia in a Jewellery Quarter cafe for lunch, but suddenly the city was put under extra restrictions which caused an emergency re-think! After a short discussion, we moved both the date and the venue back one space to the following day at the Fleur de Lys! Perfect. Not only did we see get to catch up with our Julia, we had another excellent meal and she presented us with a goody bag of homemade cakes, jam and pickle! We felt very spoilt indeed.</p>

<p>We still had to travel through Birmingham so onwards and upwards!</p>

<p>We moored in Gas Street Basin and briefly risked the market for some fresh veg, before moving swiftly on to moor outside the Black Country Museum, on our way north to explore some sections of canal new to us.</p>

<p>This time we travelled along the Birmingham New Main Line instead of the Old Main Line. The straight new canal (1827) was built to speed up the travel from Gas Street Basin to Tipton, avoiding the locks and winding nature of the Old Main Line. The older canal is much prettier than the new one but, having looked down on it from above, I was excited to be travelling along it at last.</p>

<p>I was particularly looking forward to seeing the beautiful Engine Arm aqueduct from below. It didn't disappoint. Looking up at a decorative or well engineered bridge or aqueduct from below has a similar effect on me as looking up at the architecture inside a Church or Cathedral. Awesome.</p>

<p>We spent another day in the museum, despite the weather being a little wet at times, and again managed to find a couple of bits we hadn't seen before. Of course we treated ourselves to fish and chips for lunch, finding a seat underneath a tram-stop shelter, away from the rain. 
Back at the boat we lit our first fire of the season.</p>
