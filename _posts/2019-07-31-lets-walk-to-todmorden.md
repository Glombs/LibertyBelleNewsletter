We’re going to walk to Todmorden.

We’re going to go the high way.
 

We’re not daunted!

What a beautiful day!
 

Up the rickety steps,

Woops, whoa, hup!
 

Along the nettle-y path,

Ouch, ooch, ouuch!
 

Past the reversing trucks,

Beep, beep, beep!
 

Up the tarmac’d lane,

March, march, march
 

What’s happened to our path?

Huh? Where? Back there!
 

Back down the tarmac’d lane,

Huff, huff, huff.
 

Up the steep track,

Puff, puff, puff
 

Onto the boggy path,

Squelch, squelch, squelch
 

Stop and look at the views,

Wow, wow, wow!
 

Watch the wind-farm blades,

Spin, spin, spin.
 

Follow the reservoir walk,

Stride, step, stride.
 

Turn onto the stone-flagged path,

Clomp, clomp, clomp.
 

Up onto Gaddings Dam,

Stroll, amble, stroll.
 

Look again at the views,

Gosh, wow, gosh!
 

It’s the highest ever beach*,

Where? There? How?
 

Lookout, here come the cows!

Quick, move, go!
 

Down the stone steps,

Careful, one at a time..
 

Down the steep rugged path,

Woops, steady, woah!
 

Down the flights of steps,

Step after step after step...
 

Over the stone canal bridge,

Trip, trap, trip.
 

Time for a little snack I think,

Slurp, chomp, slurp.
 

Charity shop DVD’s,

4 for £1? Yes please.
 

Hide under the stall from the rain,

Drip, drop, drip.
 

Share our fish and chips,

Chomp, chomp, chomp.
 

Back over the canal bridge,

Trip, trap, trip.
 

Along the wet towpath

Splash, splosh, splish.

 

Past the curious dog,

Sniff, snuff, sniff.
 

Sorry, we've eaten all the chips,

Sniff, oh, sniff.
 

Past the reversing trucks,

Beep, beep, beep.
 

Along the nettle-y path,

Ouch, ooch, ouuch!
 

Down the rickety steps,

Woops, whoa, steady!
 

Back onto the boat, 

Have you got the key?
 

Who’s first for the loo?

Me, me, meee!
 

What a wonderful walk.

Look at all that rain!
 

Thankfully back before the storm.

Is it time for tea?

<p>*Gaddings Dam was built in 1833 high above Todmorden to create a reservoir to supply the local mills. When the mills began to use steam power, the reservoir fell into disuse. Under threat of being drained in 2001 the reservoir was rescued by a determined group of locals who bought the dam, repaired it, and now continue to maintain it. There is a small sandy beach in one corner much loved by the local families who heroically climb the steep, rocky path to the top of the moor to play there and swim in the water. It can get very busy in the hot weather! How wonderful is that?</p>
