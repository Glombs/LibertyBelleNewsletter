<p>After an overnight stop at Hawkesbury Junction (within easy reach of the delightful Greyhound Inn) we continued along the Coventry canal which improved almost immediately. For the next couple of days we had beautiful scenery  including farmland, woods, neat back gardens, overhanging trees.... and lots of allotments. A very pleasant, winding route to the junction with the Birmingham and Fazeley Canal. Here are a few notes from our travels... 
 


<p>A delightful poem we saw at one of the locks...
<xmp>
Just a note to let you know that this here lock is very slow.

So take a breath, relax and smile, (you might be waiting here a while).

The problem is (or so we're told), that lock 13 is very old.

Her paddles shot, through wear and tear, the water pours out here and there.

We've had them fixed, then fixed again, by some of waterway's finest men.

And for a while, the lock works well, until again it leaks like hell.

Now if this pause in your sojourn, has made you stop and think and learn

That on the "cut" there is a pace, that's not for those who want to race.

So if you're "rushing", "running late", this tale of Leaky Lock you'll hate.

If you've no time to gently float, then why a bloody narrowboat?
</xmp>

<p>On Wednesday we moored up outside Pooley Country Park for a tea break. To make a change from walking the towpath we wandered into the woods at the side of the canal. We walked uphill through the silver birches to emerge into a clearing, blinded by the sunlight glinting off a mighty pillar of pure gold at the top of the hill. With my knowledge of geography and history I could positively identify it as something to do with the Incas. Unfortunately, neither of us had a camera with us at the time....</p>

<p>Sadly there were no squirrels (Tony says silver birch has nothing to offer squirrels) so Tarka was less than impressed. She had a little rest in the shade of the pillar, so at least she appreciated that, before setting off downhill to the boat. Tarka is definitely more of a downhill sort of dog.
Tarka, believing she is now the only sane one left in the pack, has assigned herself the role of Safety Officer. She can only relax when we are tied to dry land with lots of sturdy rope.
I couldn't bring myself to take a photo of this boat in all it's glory with it's owner watching me. Suffice to say it is a floating allotment. It was difficult to see the helmsman at all! The tiller was just poking out of the runner beans...</p>
