<p>In order to keep ourselves informed about the closure of locks on our way, we have signed up for automatic information emails from the Canal & River Trust (we receive several a day).</p>

<p>A recent email had informed us about a widebeam boat caught in a lock that was too narrow for it. It took some time to release the boat, by which time there was quite a queue of boats waiting to pass through. This lock was some way ahead of us at the time and the drama was all over before we reached the area. However, as soon as we did arrive at the lock, it was obvious that it was the one involved! Layers of brick had been removed from the sides of the exit. What a mess!</p>

 <p>The warning on the lock arm suggests boats should leave one at a time (so that they don't get wedged against the walls) but a widebeam is a single boat of double width, so no chance of that.</p>

<p>We left Bradford-on-Avon with the hope of getting to Newbury by 14th May to catch up with John and Viv. During the day we were lucky enough to team up with another boat, making the locks easier. This was a hire boat, crewed by two friends that both happened to have 'Holiday on a Canal Boat' on their bucket-lists, so they had decided to go together.</p>

<p>The time passed pleasantly, chatting with the woman as we worked the locks together. I asked her whether she planned to holiday on a boat again sometime.</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>She seemed quite definite!</p>

<p>We finally managed to moor for lunch at 4pm at the bottom of the Caen Hill locks, having forfeited another meal!</p>

<p>At breakfast the following morning, a boat passed us, approaching the first of the day's 29 locks. We dashed outside to ask if they would consider waiting a couple of minutes so that we could partner with them. They agreed so we hurriedly got ready and set off. We were definitely in luck. The weather was sunny, our lock partners were friendly, good company and plentiful!</p>

<p>The boat belonged to a couple who were setting off for a 3 month adventure and were accompanied by friends and family to see them on their way. The helmsmen practised moving out of one lock and into the next together, side-by-side, instead of moving one at a time, which worked very well. With the help of all these lovely people we got through the Caen Hill flight of locks before lunch! Our partners moored up beside a pub, and we carried on to do the last couple of locks on our own.</p>

<p> As we completed the last lock we were lucky enough to witness a boat leaving a mooring in front of us and we were able to slip Liberty Belle straight into the space. This gave us plenty of time to visit the local launderette, have tea and cake then explore the shops.</p>

<p>The following morning, after cruising for a while, I suddenly realised that I had left my windlass in Devizes... Oh no! This was the one Tony had bought for me at the beginning of our adventure, so it was a sad loss. We do, however, have several spares, so not a disaster.</p>

<p>I did some of the steering and felt confident enough to think I could control Liberty Belle in front of a swing bridge and let Tony step off to open it. Well, I didn't quite hit the moored boats nor did I actually bash into the side of the bridge, but for the next swing bridge, I tied Liberty Belle up until I could steer straight through.</p>

<p>Later, as Tony was guiding Liberty Belle past some moored boats, a widebeam boat called Rachel came into view, heading in the opposite direction. Tony moved over slightly and there was plenty of room. We were just joking about Rachels being broad in the beam when she suddenly started heading straight for us! We had nowhere to go to get out of the way and she rammed us.</p>

<p>Of course we were then in danger of hitting the moored boats, so I tried to fend them off whilst Tony tried to steer us out of trouble. There was no apology or even eye contact from Rachel's crew! Flippin' 'eck! Don't insult Rachels. Just don't.</p>

<p>We moored up briefly at the water tap outside The Barge Inn at Honeystreet and were told that it would be opening on 24th May, and asked to spread the word. Consider it done.</p>

<p>Continuing on our way we saw our first cygnets of the year and glimpsed our first bluebells through the trees. We were also seen off by a brave swan who escorted us to the edge of his territory. He seemed quite proud that he had seen off such a large creature. Well done Mr. Swan.</p>

<p>Later in the day we teamed up with a loan boater, Andy, to do the locks. He works for a marina, moving boats around the network. It seems that his work is a bit hit-and-miss but he has been working 7 days a week most weeks since Christmas. He tries to get as many miles done as he can each day but it is very hard work without crew so he likes to share the locks whenever possible. He was friendly and chatty and the partnership worked well.</p>

<p>It was a lovely day full of cuckoos, swallows, kingfishers, red kites (often being mobbed by other birds), ducklings, goslings, cygnets, and wagtails nesting in the locks gates. The canal was covered in a white carpet of downy willow tree seed 'fluff'. </p>

<p>As evening approached we found a single mooring space so we shared it with Andy by tying the two boats side by side. We agreed to set off early the next morning and continue our partnership. Andy explained that the Kennet & Avon is so low on water for the time of year that it is in danger of being closed so we should get outta here. Enough said.</p>

<p>The next morning we set off as planned and completed our journey to Hungerford in very good time. We moored there for the night and Andy carried on, he had more to do than us.</p>

<p>After Hungerford, we shared locks with a boat called Matilda and her husband & wife crew. We moored in Newbury, one behind the other, in the perfect place, pretty and centrally located. We had a little look around and found ourselves in a canalside cafe.</p>

<p>John and Viv managed to find us the following day and we explored Newbury with our guests. Yet again we were lucky with the weather and had a delightful day.</p>
