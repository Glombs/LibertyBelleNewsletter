<p>Onwards again, we tried to stop at a water tap & elsan point but there were two boats moored there, so no room for us. We snuck into an empty private mooring whilst we investigated. One boat was broken down and there was no answer from the other boat...hmmmm. So, onwards again...

<p>Our next stop was Braunston marina, at the junction, to buy coal. A boat was moored there too and not ready to leave but he suggested we moored up against him. Tony managed to manoeuvre Liberty Belle alongside successfully. In the chandlers the staff informed us that they had already tried to encourage the owner of the moored boat to leave so we thought we might never be able to load our coal. Tony braved the chap and persuaded him to move on. More tricky manoeuvring and we were in a position to have our purchase loaded. We made use of their Elsan point and bins then another tricky turn to enter the correct arm of the canal for our journey towards Oxford.</p>

<p>We stopped off at a village called Lower Shuckburgh which had some lovely houses, a network of footpaths across the surrounding fields, a manor house, a church, a war memorial and a set of stocks.</p>

<p>Walking with Tarka along the tow path I tripped over a section of metal sticking out of the ground. Bruised, shaken, embarrassed, emotional and sorry for myself I managed to jump on board with Tarka under my arm. More aches and pains for the old girl to add to the collection!</p>

<p>We arrived at Napton-On-The-Hill (with Nap meaning hilltop and Ton meaning settlement, you'd think 'on-the-hill' would be superfluous...) and moored near a wonderful pub called The Folly which had good atmosphere, beer and live music. Every  time the door opened, someone would peer in, see there was no room and come in anyway! A Tardis of a pub!</p>

<p>The next morning we went through the lock which was due to close from 5th November until 21st December, for some major work. So that job was done.</p>

<p>The sofa bed saga continues... We hadn't had a phone call or a delivery because the sofa bed had gone missing. Tony contacted John Lewis, they located it and it will be delivered on Wednesday. We found a mooring place a few locks down near a bridge where a van could be parked and a sofa carried between the two of us. Tony then got to work, booking a van, checking bus and train times and locating the bus stop in Napton. </p>

<p>We returned to The Folly for a Sunday roast. We couldn't see an actual folly but that doesn't mean there isn't one.</p>

<p>Tony went back to the house and returned a few days later with the sofa bed. Meanwhile Tarka kept me company on Liberty Belle at our mooring space with a backdrop of Napton wrapped around its hill.</p>
