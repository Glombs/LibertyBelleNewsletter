<p>I don't usually send newsletters out of sync but I am making an exception in this case.</p>
<p>We left Liberty Belle moored in Banbury on Wednesday and came back to the house. Tarka had recently been showing signs that her medication needed tweaking, (always hungry and thirsty), so we took the opportunity to take her to the vet (something Tarka enjoys as she gets lots of attention and tasty treats for her trouble - Win Win!).</p>
<p>She passed her 'MOT' on Thursday and had the usual blood test so that her medication could be altered according to the results.</p>
<p>Suddenly, on Friday afternoon, she became very sad and clingy. I was also feeling sorry for myself, coming down with a cold, so we kept each other company in front of the fire. Poor Tarka became increasingly uncomfortable so Tony heroically carried her in his arms to our local vet first thing on Saturday morning, where she was declared to be a very poorly little dog. </p>
<p>The next 24 hours involved pain killers, antibiotics, anti-sickness, antacid, muscle relaxants, urine tests, blood tests and scans, as well as transportation to a weekend pet clinic (thanks Joe) which involved an about-turn half way home to sign the paperwork that had been forgotten and a return journey to take her pills to her the next morning. </p>
<p>By Sunday afternoon it was clear that Tarka, despite the drugs, had deteriorated. We gave the vet the go ahead to end her pain.</p>
<p>Our Tarka 'Boo', much loved family pet; companion; friend; listening ear; comforter; third Liberty Belle crew member; combined 'Safety Officer' and 'Trip Hazard'; didn't quite make her thirteenth birthday.</p>
<p>It was sudden, Tony and I were with her, and we just happened to be at the house when it happened, so we were able to get her the help she needed straight away. Joe made himself and his car available for transporting her from one clinic to another. For these things we are grateful. Anyone who knew her will know that she was a huge part of our daily lives and will be, to say the least, missed.</p>
