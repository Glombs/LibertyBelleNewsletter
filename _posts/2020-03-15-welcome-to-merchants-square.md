 <p>Hi Paddington!</p>
 </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>So, there we were, fighting Storm Dennis as we approached Paddington Basin. We had booked and paid for our mooring in advance because we had arranged to meet Joe, Kirsty and Carter there in a few days time. We were all looking forward to a bit of sight-seeing there before we explored the River Lee. As it was so windy, it was a relief to know that they were expecting us (or, as our confirmation email had stated, "looking forward to seeing you"), because turning around in the basin and searching for a possibly non-existent mooring space was going to be doubly difficult.</p>

<p>As we passed the restaurant boat, 'Darcie Green', permanently moored outside Paddington station, the wind, funnelled between the buildings, became very strong and we only just missed knocking the boat as the diners watched...</p>

<p>(The next boat to come along behind us did bump into poor Darcie and just stayed there overnight, moored against the restaurant!)</p>

<p>We carried on, arriving just in front of our pontoon in the Merchants Square area of Paddington Basin.</p>

<p>There was no space!</p>

<p>What?</p>

<p>Now what do we do?</p>

<p>We pulled over to the edge of the canal and I held onto the centre rope, whilst Tony went to investigate the pontoon situation. Storm Dennis wasn't keen on Liberty Belle staying where she was but I stood my ground!</p>

<p>Whilst Tony was confirming the lack of mooring space, a security guard approached me and insisted that I move our boat. Tony returned and we both tried to explain that we had booked and payed for a mooring on the pontoon and we were not going to travel past the pontoon, turn and return the way we had come, partly because it was far too windy but mostly because we had already paid to be here!</p>

<p>Our explanation did little to stem the flow of his insistence that we move.</p>

<p>Tony tied Liberty Belle to the light fittings to save my arm muscles, (which probably didn't go down too well), then went on board to contact the Canal & River Trust as it was far too windy outside for a phone conversation. After the usual confusion, they requested that Tony take a note of the number of each of the 6 boats on the pontoon. This he did. It didn't help much.</p>

<p>Finally, the security guard's immediate boss, Duke, arrived and showed us a CRT mooring amongst some little hire boats which we could use. He and the original guard helped with Liberty Belle's ropes and we tied up to the temporary mooring, after promising the CRT that we would move onto the official pontoon as soon as a space became available.</p>

<p>Ok. Great. Agreed.</p>

<p>(Well, agreed, except we were not going to stay on the boat all day waiting for this to happen, we had paid to be here and we were going to make the most of it..!)</p>

<p>We all shook hands, (probably the last hand-shakes of 2020) and, with smiles all around, Duke said "Welcome to Merchants Square".</p>

<p>So off we went for a walk along the Regents Canal. When we returned the pontoon situation was still the same so we settled down for the night.</p>

<p>Just before our 7 a.m. alarm, we were woken by a knocking noise on the boat which gradually travelled from the front of the boat to the back... What could it be?</p>

<p>As the knocking got closer to the back we realised it was accompanied by a voice, asking to speak to the occupant.</p>

<p>Tony stuck his head out of the hatch above our back door and spoke to the two security guards who insisted that we move the boat. Tony insisted he would not and tried to explain the situation, when he could get a word in...</p>

<p>Eventually Duke arrived and sorted things out. Good grief.</p>

<p>We checked the pontoon situation, which hadn't changed, so off we went for a day in London.</p>

<p>On our return things were still the same so we settled down for the night.</p>

<p>The following morning we got up at our own speed, to find that one of the boats on the pontoon was setting off. Great. We moved Liberty Belle into the space, as promised. Phew.</p>

<p>Once we were moored, one of the other boats left too, which was very lucky, because the first boat returned from collecting water to find us in his space....</p>

<p>We kept a low profile and went into London again for more sight-seeing. As it was raining, we decided to spend the day in the Victoria and Albert Museum, one of our favourites, and broke the journey back with a visit to The Victoria, a very smart pub near Paddington.</p>

<p>After yet another day in the same place, we were running very low on water, so Tony took our large plastic water containers on several trips to a not-so-nearby tap and topped up Liberty Belle's tank using those. Where was I when all this heavy work was taking place? In the launderette. That's important work too, right?</p>

<p>So by the time Joe, Kirsty and Carter arrived we were moored where we were supposed to be, all clean and topped up with water. They had driven to Hertford, parked the van and taken the train to Paddington, via Liverpool Street station and the underground. Quite an adventure for a puppy!</p>

<p>After a couple of days together in London (during which Kirsty introduced me to the shopping heaven that is Whole Food Market. Oh my goodness, I haven't lived!), we set off to spend half term travelling along the Lee Navigation (in the rain) to find Joe's van.</p>

<h2>Where Next?</h2>

<p>We are now in Bishops Stortford waiting for Cathy to join us by train tomorrow. Our future plans are still the same.</p>

<p>Good luck to all those who are self-isolating and those abroad who have no choice, as well as those who are waiting to see whether they are wanted at work or not. In fact, good luck to us all.</p>

<p>Keep each other safe and well. xx</p>
