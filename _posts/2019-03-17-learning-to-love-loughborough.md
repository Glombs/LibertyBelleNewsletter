<p>It soon became apparent that the weather wasn't going to improve any time soon. As the days went by the Canal & River Trust closed the River Trent in front of us and the River Soar behind, because of high water. Oh... We were stuck.</p>

<p>Over the next couple of days we explored Loughborough, the birthplace of Ladybird Books (oh yes indeedy). We shared our time between Wetherspoons, the excellent (and free) museum, the well stocked aviary, the shops and the launderette.  We began to be concerned about our water running out so we decided to move around the corner into the wharf. We carefully picked our time to avoid the worst of the wind and rain. The rain fell in stair rods and the wind prevented us from mooring alongside the tap. We gave up and moored against the pontoon (with some difficulty) and hung all our wet clothes around the boat with towels beneath to catch the worst of the drips! The next day we were more successful, managing to collect water and re-moor without any trouble. Whilst waiting for the water tank to fill Tony used his fishing net to collect all the rubbish floating around in the wharf and binned it.</p>

<p>We were now in a mooring spot restricted to 24 hours but:-

<ul>
    <li>most of the facilities supposedly on offer were in fact out of order (toilets, elsan & showers)</li>
    <li>we couldn't travel due to rising water levels</li>
    <li>No-one else was moored here or likely to arrive</li>
</ul>

 <p>I am so fond of this statue. I have never been fond of a statue before. He is delightful. He is wearing and admiring a single sock. (In case you are worried, he also has a strategically placed fig leaf.) Bless him!.</p>

 <p>Well done Loughborough, this is what you call a war memorial! It is 46 metres tall and has a collection of 47 bells. It is open to the public but not until Easter. I wonder if we will still be here.....</p>

<p>So we thought the Canal & River Trust would probably leave us in peace.</p>


<p>Meanwhile we are running out of coal and, as we can't travel to any marinas, have no chance of getting any more. Access to elsan points is also impossible (too much information?).</p>

<p>So, we have been preserving our coal for the evenings and using public WC's (by that I mean in supermarkets, pubs and cafe's). This situation, of course, makes Wetherspoons and their bottomless top-ups (if that makes senseâ€¦)  invaluable! We are becoming very good at making the drinking of a single pint of beer fill the time available.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Tony began to feel trapped. He was cheered only by sightings of the pet ferret being taken out on his daily walk and his regular trips (in the gaps in the weather) to the nearest lock to keep an eye on water levels.</p>

<p>On one of the better days weather-wise we decided to go for a walk along the towpath to see where the canal joins the River Trent and Erewash Canal at Trent Lock. We planned to treat ourselves to a pub lunch there and then catch the train back to Loughborough. On the way we saw a whole field full of lapwings rising just above the ground, doing a few acrobatics then landing again. The towpath gradually and mysteriously morphed into a public footpath on the flood plain alongside the river. We boldly continued on our way until we reached the junction. Trent Lock was on the opposite side of the river to us and there was no bridge. We were stranded on the flood plain. How could this happen? What did the horses used to do when towing a boat? Swim across?
We were dismayed. We could either walk back the way we had come with no hope of lunch, or carry on following the footpath across the floodplain towards civilisation. So we carried on, moving further away from the river, across farmland, to a small country road which we followed under the railway and into the village of Sawley, situated not far from a railway station. We found three pubs, one of which belonged to an unappealing chain, one served very sad looking food, the third was selling excellent ale from its own brewery but no food other than crisps and nuts. What to do?</p>

<p>We were so busy enjoying our beer (and very hot chilli bar snacks that actually made Tony cry) that we missed our first train. It had been a very close thing but 'a miss is as good as a mile'. Never mind, it wasn't a long wait for the next train and we were merry enough not to be too upset! We got back to the boat and had a slap-up curry.</p>

<p>By now we were well into March. We had originally travelled up here to kill time whilst we waited for the lock in Reading to open on 15th. So we decided to abandon our plan of going to Nottingham and head back to Oxford as soon as the canals were open again. We would, of course, take Liberty Belle to Nottingham some other time but for now, to keep ourselves entertained, we decided to go there by train. Our journey was uneventful (except that we saw those blessed cooling towers again). We collected a tourist map from the information centre and started to follow it. It was so windy that our map was soon swept away so we went back for 2 more! It soon became apparent that Nottingham likes its tourists to pay for its attractions. Now, don't get me wrong, that is absolutely fair enough .... but we restricted ourselves to the free stuff.</p>

<p>So the magical date of 15th March has come and gone. We are still here, in Loughborough, and Tony is still pacing up and down the towpath. Wetherspoons is an oasis for us. Not always an oasis of calm, due to the rugby, but we are not about to complain. The washing has been kept up to date, thanks to the launderette, some tinkering with DIY has been done and I have caught up with the Newsletters...</p>
