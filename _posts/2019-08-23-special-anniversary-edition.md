<p>Wow! It was a whole year ago that we bought Liberty Belle and began our journey.</p>

<ul>
    <li>We have travelled along 1163 miles of canal, through 1245 locks.</li>
    <li>We have discovered several ways to sink a canal boat and attempted two of them.</li>
    <li>Liberty Belle has gained a few dents and lost some paint along the way.</li>
    <li>We have passed the time of day with lots of people and seen countless boats (mostly moored), some of them more than once!</li>
    <li>We have visited hamlets, villages, towns & cities, museums, churches, minsters & cathedrals.</li>
    <li>We have weathered all kinds of weather including too hot, too cold, too wet and too windy.</li>
</ul>

<p>What an adventure!</p>

<h2>Things we have learnt</h2>

<ul>
    <li>A plan rarely comes together</li>
    <li>You should never pass a tap without topping up with water</li>
    <li>Steering in reverse is mostly a matter of luck</li>
    <li>Even if you think you don't need fenders at a mooring, you need fenders.</li>
    <li>The BBC Weather App talks nonsense</li>
    <li>There are a few narrow boats called Liberty Belle but most are called Carpe Diem, Narrow Escape or Meander</li>
    <li>There are no Waitrose shops in the North</li>
    <li>It's not what a museum has but how it presents it that is important.</li>
    <li>Wet coal doesn't burn hot.</li>
    <li>Coal is always wet because it is packed in special plastic bags that allow rain in but not out again.</li>
    <li>There is no time to learn a new language or read a book or practice the ukulele or do a crossword or embroider.</li>
    <li>It is possible for a couple to live on a narrow boat for a whole year and remain married...</li>
    <li>Just because there is a mooring space/toilet/elsan point/tap marked on the map, it isn't necessarily there.</li>
    <li>Ducks are good mothers and geese are just shit machines</li>
    <li>Despite there being 34,000 canal boats registered there are hardly any actually moving on the canals. We can travel for days without meeting any! (There was a brief flurry one day in June..)</li>
    <li>Our fears are usually unfounded.</li>
    <li>A day isn't long enough, nor is a year...</li>
</ul>

<h2>Visitors</h2>

<p>We love having visitors! Some pop by for a cuppa, some visit for the day and others stay and travel with us. We don't always remember to take photos of our visitors but here are some we did take...</p>

<p>We also had some near misses from Craig (passing by on a train), Aub (a day or so out of sync), Chris and Jan (unknowingly nearby in their camper van)...plus others, I'm sure!</p>

<h2>Future Plans</h2>

<p>Well, bearing in mind that our plans rarely come together...</p>

<p>We intend to travel through Yorkshire, to Liverpool, Lancaster, Cheshire and Wales before heading south for the winter. We still need to study the winter lock stoppages but we think Milton Keynes will be a good winter base. We still have a lot of miles to explore so we will need at least one more summer....</p>

<p>Watch this space.</p>

<h2>Our travels so far.</h2>
