<h2>From Marsworth to Kings Langley</h2>
<h2>3rd - 19th January 2020</h2>

<p>So, with the festive season behind us, (feeling somewhat heavier and less fit, as is traditional), we journeyed back to Marsworth where we had left Liberty Belle. We try not to worry about abandoning our boat but it is always a relief when we find her exactly where we left her, safe and sound, with nothing missing...</p>

<p>We had to walk a couple of miles or so from Tring railway station so we hadn't packed any food from home, and there was no food on board, so we were obliged to eat in the local pub.... Shame!</p>

<p>The following morning we travelled through 7 locks and found a mooring on the outskirts of Berkhamsted. Still having no food, we walked into the town, ate in a pub again (what a bad habit), then walked back via Waitrose where we picked up a few bits. We pulled Liberty Belle over at the 2 hour shopping mooring right outside Waitrose as we passed by the next morning and stocked up properly. So far so good!</p>

 <p>A little further along the canal, this lock gate must surely be next on the list for replacement!</p>

<p>Suddenly, out of nowhere, we had our first experience of canal rage! On a wide stretch of canal we saw a boat heading towards us. There was plenty of room but the oncoming boat didn't seem to be taking advantage of the width, heading straight for us. Tony gradually moved more and more to the right, closer and closer to the fishermen lining the towpath. Strangely, the other boat seemed to be hugging the towpath too. Suddenly he started shouting at Tony, demanding that he use his common sense and pass on the other side! One of the fishermen, assuming that boats should stay on the left, as cars do, joined in! Many words were exchanged....</p>

<p>The boats just managed to miss each other and no fishing equipment was damaged but it was quite an episode, albeit a slow motion one! We still don't know what it was all about.</p>

<p>We moored in Berkhamsted for several days outside The Rising Sun, known to the locals and boaters as "The Riser", a pub we came across last time we were here and rather like!</p>

<p>Berkhamsted is a pleasant town with proper shops, an excellent community cafe, some historical interest and plenty of walks in the hills around, so we weren't short of things to do.</p>

<p>Walking around the area we came across a monument to the 3rd Duke of Bridgewater who created the first canals to carry coal from his mines in Worsley. (We visited the wharf there during one of  Mary's visits.) It seems the family seat was the Ashridge Estate, near Berkhamsted. The monument was built quite some time after his death and the widow of his successor, who was resident at the time, insisted that the monument was erected far enough away from the house to prevent her from seeing it because she found it so ugly. I have to sympathise with her....</p>

<p>Hemel Hempstead has much to admire. It has a wide pedestrianised town centre with a variety of shops and long strip down the middle dedicated to children's play areas and various types of seating, some of which are under cover. On this main street is the entrance to a covered shopping centre which has a soft play area, comfortable seating and toilet facilities with large cubicles for family use, changing facilities with a hoist, large enough for use by an adult, curtained babyfeeding cubicles with comfy armchairs and a small kitchen with microwave. Beat that!</p>

<p>What's more, there is a long strip of garden following the river, which separates the main shopping street from the car parks, which are well hidden from sight as you stroll along the winding path.</p>

<p>I wouldn't suggest it is somewhere to go out of your way for, but if you are in the area, Hemel Hempstead is worth a look.</p>

<p>In our wanderings we also found the historic town of Old Hemel Hempstead which still has its own high street with some interesting old buildings as well as a delightful public park and play area.</p>

<p>Near our mooring space was the SunnySide Farm Shop and Cafe where a charity employs adults with learning difficulties to grow and sell produce, look after the hens, and run the cafe. We felt we should support them so we bought a loaf of bread, some expensive, tiny eggs and some extremely expensive washing-up liquid refill. I just hope it's super-concentrated!</p>

<p>One day, in search of a launderette, we walked along the canal to visit Kings Langley. On the way back we stopped at a cafe boat where we had tea and cake whilst listening to the owner's unfavourable opinion of the Canal & River Trust. It seems that they have made it difficult for him to run his business. Shame on them.</p>
 
<p>Once the weather was more favourable we moved Liberty Belle to Kings Langley.
Joe was hoping to meet up with us so we walked from KIngs Langley to Watford looking out for a suitable mooring space on the way. We needed a parking space near by as well as easy access to a railway station so that Joe could spend the day working in London.</p>

<p>On our walk we came across a boat that was straddling the canal, its back mooring pins having worked their way out of the sodden ground, and the front pins were only just holding too. It was effectively blocking passage for any other boats as well as being in danger of drifting off. Tony contacted the Canal & River Trust to explain the situation and they contacted the owners. That was our good deed for the day done!</p>

<p>We returned from Watford on the train, having concluded that Liberty Belle was already in the best position.</p>

<p>The following day we had a nose around Kings Langley where we found a church cafe selling excellent cakes and a fish and chip shop! Not a bad day!</p>

<p>Joe and his puppy, Carter, joined us that evening and stayed for a couple of nights. During the day Joe went into work by train and we got to play with Carter!</p>

<p>After Joe and Carter had gone back to their normal lives, we decided to follow in Joe's footsteps and take a train into London for the day. We saw the Wallace Collection, which is well worth a visit, caught up with Robin, walked along the river and took in the views from level 10 in the Tate Modern. It was a pleasant, sunny, satisfying day but tiring. When we got back on the boat we just managed to have a shower each before we completely ran out of water! Oh well, we will have to move tomorrow to find the next tap...</p>

<h2>Where Next?</h2>

<p>We are gradually making our way into London, as slowly as our water supply will allow, hoping that we will find suitable moorings as we go. In the spring we tentatively plan to travel North up the rivers Lee and Stort then, (via the Thames), tackle the River Wey and Basingstoke canal, followed by the Thames to Lechlade.</p>
