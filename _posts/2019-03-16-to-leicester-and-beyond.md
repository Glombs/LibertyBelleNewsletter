<p>As we approached Leicester we had our first abuse from a fisherman! He was a young chap with a young woman hovering in the background. He had been pointing out the water coming from the lock as we descended and had settled himself on the bank with his fishing rod. Liberty Belle was eased out of the lock. I stepped onto the deck after closing the gates, looked over at the fisherman and smiled. In response he stood up and shouted at us</p>

<p>"Don't you know you are supposed to slow down when you pass fishermen?"</p>

<p>Despite us knowing that this isn't the case I simply pointed out that we couldn't go any slower without losing steering and he wouldn't want that.</p>

<p>"I could report you!"</p>

<p>Tony suggested that he should go ahead and do that.</p>

<p>"Other people have been done you know!"</p>

<p>We shrugged at him and carried on.  I hope the young woman was impressed by his knowledge and bravado otherwise the whole event was a waste.</p>

<p>We stayed in Leicester for the weekend at our secure mooring at the Castle Garden. There was a lot of interesting architecture both old and new. You can't move around the city without regularly coming across information boards about its history.</p>

<p>We visited the Cathedral where a very friendly curate, after inviting everyone to pause and join her in the Lords Prayer, smiled at me as we sat down then came and chatted to us about the cathedral, the different visitors they get there; the local rugby team colours; how she became a curate; her duties as curate; the funerals she had conducted... She made us feel very welcome and we liked her.</p>

<p>The ancient Guildhall, dating back to 1390, is beautiful and well worth a visit. It was due to be demolished in the 1920's because it had become dilapidated and was considered an eyesore but local historians thankfully stepped in and saved it, opening it as a museum in 1926.</p>

<p>The local market was excellent, with lots of vibrant stalls. It is undercover and the wooden stalls are permanent. In the evenings a group of Sikhs hand out food to the homeless from one of the stalls, to the sound of loud and jolly music.</p>

<p>In the main street there are billboards which have free integrated phones (modern ones with no handsets), WiFi, phone charging ports and access to local information. (BT Inlink). What a wonderful resource. We saw a couple of homeless people using them but they were first brought to our attention when we encountered a very drunk man shouting abuse relating to his mother at a billboard one late afternoon.  Of course it turned out that he was actually talking to his mother on the phone. I'm not sure which is worse.</p>

<p>Having looked them up on the Infi-net it seems they have been installed in lots of places around the country...</p>

<p>On the Saturday evening we attended an event celebrating the life of local suffragette, Alice Hawkins, in the square that contains her statue. It was entertaining, educational and very moving.</p>

<p>We found some disappointments in Leicester. The Jewry Wall Museum (part of the Roman town) was closed for refurbishment and the Richard III museum was exhausting. We felt that it was no different from reading a book about him except you had to stand throughout.</p>

 <p>We can't help thinking that she must have looked better from a greater distance. If they had to save her, perhaps a taller pedestal would have been a good move...</p>

<p>On the Monday we set off despite strong winds. It was slow going as we encountered some very heavy lock gates and one lock full of rubbish that we needed to push clear with the boat hook before we could open it. We got Liberty Belle in there, shut the gates behind her and started to empty out the water through the bottom gates. We soon realised that the top gates weren't shut properly so the water was just passing through both sets of gates. We had to stop, let the lock refill completely, ease apart the top gates and clear the rubbish caught between them. </p>

<p>This involved Tony being precariously balanced on the partly opened gates which were desperately trying to shut together whilst he wielded the boat hook to push the rubbish out of the way. That done, we started again.</p>

<p>As we left Leicester the river was lined with parkland, old factories, new housing and a wildlife park. We saw cormorants, a kingfisher, a little grebe, herons, an egret and a pair of Gadwell ducks (identified by Tony The Birdman).</p>

<p>After the last lock of the day Tony couldn't bring Liberty Belle to the side due to the wind, so after closing the gates I was left stranded! There were no opportunities for me to be picked up for half a mile. Despite trying to travel slowly, Liberty Belle was being swept along in the flow of the river so I had trouble walking fast enough to keep up, particularly as I had styles to climb and a muddy track to contend with! She must have been going at a crazy 4 miles an hour! </p>

<p>Finally we met at our nighttime mooring in Mountsorrel, just before the next lock. It was a fascinating little village with an ancient castle site and several sculptures done by a chap called Mike Grevatte.</p>

<p>The following day we travelled to Loughborough. On the way we saw loads of Canada Geese and some Greylags, a swan sitting bolt upright on a nest and our first ducklings (yay!). </p>

<p>We moored up just outside Loughborough Wharf in a residential area. We decided to stay there to shelter from the high winds expected on the following day.</p>
