<h2>From Skipton to Barnoldswick</h2>

<p>After the lovely Bank Holiday weekend we woke up to rain so we delayed our departure whilst we visited the launderette.</p>

<p>We had thought we would be able to 'nip' up to Lancaster before collecting Mary in Liverpool, but because the route passes through the tidal section of the Ribble, there are specific windows of opportunity when the tide is right and the locks are manned. Unfortunately we would either have to rush and see very little or take too long and delay the rest of our plans, so we will have to come back and complete that section another time.</p>

<p>So, off towards Liverpool! The canal began to wind around, following the contours of the land and making steering in the wind quite tricky... We would have had some beautiful views if it were not for the high hedges alongside the canal.</p>

<p>Suddenly we had views across the countryside as we ascended the pretty Greenberfield Locks to the highest point on the Leeds & Liverpool Canal. After these the locks would be taking us downhill to Liverpool.</p>

<p>The facilities at Greenberfield were excellent, including hot showers, a refreshments booth (calling itself a cafe) and a friendly lock keeper who recommended some moorings at Barnoldswick. </p>

<p>As it was raining we decided to have our cup of tea on the boat rather than outside the cafe booth but I went to see if I could buy some cake from the lady serving. I explained the situation and she sold me two slices of banana, sultana and walnut cake to take away. During our chat she asked me where we were going and she advised me not to stop in Burnley on our way to Liverpool as it has a bad reputation amongst boaters... Oh heck, that was one of the places we had hoped to moor overnight later in the week. I thanked her for the advice and we altered our future plans accordingly...</p>

<p>Whilst in the room housing the Elsan point facility, Tony discovered a swallow's nest. We took it in turns to stand there and watch the mother bird coming and going through the open window. We wondered if she will have time to rear her baby before it's time to fly off for the winter...</p>

<p>Eventually we left the swallows in peace and found the excellent moorings at Barnoldswick. We were pleased to discover that it was a proper little market town which had grown due to the arrival of the canal which had facilitated the building of textile mills.</p>

<p>Bancroft Mill, dating from 1914, was the last one built and continued until 1978. The engine house has been preserved as a museum by volunteers who regularly run the engine. Tony and I went to visit and, despite it not being a steam day and all the volunteers being in a meeting and so unavailable, we found the museum to be fascinating. The displays of old photographs and artefacts along with the explanatory notes were expertly done.</p>

<p>After all that history we treated ourselves to a drink in The Barlick Tap, housed in the original village Co-Op. (Barlick has been a local alternative name for Barnoldswick for hundreds of years apparently.)</p>

<p>The barman's mother was the daughter of a butcher and knew how to make the best sausage rolls which were being offered at the bar for a donation in the charity collecting pot... Jackpot!</p>

<p>We decided to stay here an extra day so that we could walk in the hills surrounding the town and, of course, re-visit The Barlick Tap...!</p>

<p>Before setting off the next morning, we went for a brief walk to try and find the remains of an old canal arm near our mooring. The arm was only 1/2 mile long and went through two tunnels to a quarry where the stone was loaded directly onto barges.</p>

<p>The quarry has been filled in and presumably used as a landfill site because there are several vents emerging from the ground.</p>

<p>The canal arm is derelict and overgrown but sections of it can still be seen.</p>

<p>So, off we went. It seemed that Leeds and Liverpool Canal weaves around the Lancashire border because we came across several 'Welcome to Lancashire' signs over the next few days. Strangely we are not usually informed of our exit from any county. There was one exception to this.</p>

<p>Our route now took us through Foulridge Tunnel. It is a mile long and is only wide enough to take one boat at a time. The entry is controlled by traffic lights with only a 10 minute window each hour in which to start your journey through. The lights were against us when we arrived but after stopping at the facilities in front of the tunnel to fill up on water, we just had time to start the engine, untie and move to the waiting area when the lights were suddenly in our favour.</p>

</figure>
 
<p>Soon after the tunnel we arrived at our safe mooring in Barrowford, just a couple of miles from the dreaded Burnley....</p>

<p>With our usual assumption that troublesome people are not early risers, we set our alarm clock for an early start, hoping to get through unhindered!</p>

<h2>Where Next?</h2>

<p>Still on course for Liverpool on 11th September. The plans to go to Chester, Ellesmere Port and then Stone look more and more ambitious as we look into the detail... We still hope to get back to the house some time in October.</p>
