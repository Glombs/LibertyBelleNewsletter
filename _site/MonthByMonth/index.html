<p>We picked the boat up in the last week of August. We hired a van to carry all out things to the boat at Crick. We set off through Crick Tunnel with plans for Tony to walk back so that he could return the hire van to Eastleigh. We had our first problem in that the Watford locks were closed when we reached them so had to moor up nearby. Tony travelled home while Rachel discovered our next problem. We had run out of water! Fortunately there were toilet facilities at the top of Watford locks.</p>

<p>I returned the next day by train and after a cold and uncomfortable night in our bed we set off.</p>

<p>We had our first near disaster as we caught the boat on a lock cill at Norton. We rescued the boat just in time in front of an audience of pub frequenters nearby.</p>

<p>Joe and Kirsty were volunteering at a nearby music festival and wanted to meet up. We worked out that Norton Junction would be a good place to meet up with relatively good access to a railway station for Joe to return to after our cruise.</p>

<p>We had a little bit of time so we travelled the few miles to Weedon, where we went out for a lovely curry, Weedon Bec and back.</p>

<p>Joe and Kirsty joined us for a couple of days.</p>

<p>We did Braunston Tunnel for the first time and then moved on to Rugby where Joe and Kirsty left us. Tony ordered a new mattress to replace the very uncomfortable one on the boat hoping that its delivery would coincide with my visit home to take Tarka to the vet for more tablets.</p>

<p>We then cruised on to Coventry with a plan to meet up with Robin there.</p>

<h2>September 2018</h2>

<p>Robin came to visit for the wekend bringing our new mattress. We explored the city a bit and visited 'The Greyhound' pub at Hawkesbury junction.</p>

<p>Tony went home with Robin, mostly to visit the vet to get more pills for Tarka but stayed for a few days doing jobs.</p>

<p>Rachel was using the free WiFi in IKEA and Wetherspoons to publish her newsletters. Tony and Tarka travelled back on the train. After a visit to the excellent Coventry Transport Museum we travelled to Bristol by train for a weekend with Cathy, Will, John and Melissa.</p>

<p>While we were in Bristol, Robin and Ben borrowed the boat, had Liberty Belle's first breakdown after travelling just a few hundred yards, and cruised from Coventry to Nuneaton and back.</p>

<p>We had made arrangements to collect Mary for a cruise starting in Birmimgham so we made our way there via Atherstone, Polesworth,  Fazeley Junction, Tamworth and Salford Junction.</p>

<p>In Birmingham we moored outside the O2 Arena which was lovely but noisey at night with drunken revellers breaking glass on the towpath. We met up with Julia for curry at her favourite Indian restaurant, Itihaas, and discovered Damascena, a Middle Eastern coffee shop and cafe.</p>

<p>Mary arrived by train and with her on board we cruised to Stratford upon Avon, getting wedged in a narrow lock and, by chance, deciding to go to the 'Fleur de Lys' pub in Lowsonford where Julia, knowing the pub well, joined us for lunch.</p>

<p>We did some sight-seeing in Wooten Wawen and Wilmecote visiting the very interesting and informative Mary Arden's House and Tudor Farm where Mary and Tony had a go at goose herding!</p>

<p>While moored in Stratford on Avon Tony had an accident and lost his glasses in the water by the pontoon but these were recovered using a fishing landing net purchased at Argos!</p>

<p>We explored all the Shakespeare tourist attractions and Joe and Kirsty joined us for the weekend and celebrated Rachel's birthday wth a family breakfast.</p>

<p>We cruised back towards Leamington Spa, where Mary was due to go home from, stopping for lunch again at the 'Fleur de Lys' pub in Lowsonford.</p>

<h2>October 2018</h2>

 <figcaption>

<p>We completed our journey from Stratford upon Avon to Leamington Spa.</p>

<p>We joined the Grand Union Canal at Kingswood junction and headed for Warwick down the Hatton flight of locks. We had a short explore in Warwick and moved on to Lemingon Spa the next day.</p>

<p>We went home on the train from Leamington with Mary but had to get off at the next station as Mary's ticket was not valid for that train.</p>

<p>On our return to the boat at Leamington we travelled on and visited Radford Semele and Long Itchington, which I particulalry liked. It had a lot of pubs, a village pond and a nice busy feel to it.</p>

<p>While moored tony installed some USB sockets on the boat in place of the 12V cigarette socket under the TV as the weather was poor.</p>

<p>When we first got the boat, we had ordered a sofa bed and needed to collect it once it was delivered to our house. We wanted to be reasonably close to home for this as Tony would have to bring the sofa bed to the boat in a hire van and then drive back home the same day to drop off the van. We thought that Norton Junction might be a good place to do this as it is familiar to us, has good road access and a relatively close railway station. but it was too soon to go there just yet.</p>

<p>So on our return from home we decided to cruise to Northampton and back to kill some time.</p>

<p>We cruised to Braunston where we had to moor up in a private spot as it was getting dark. We moved on a little the next morning and then stayed for a couple of days and visited the 'Admiral Nelson' which had a nice feel to it.<p>

<p>While here Tony booked an appointment to have solar panels installed by Tim from Onboard Solar. We will have to make sure we are moored somewhere that has road access when he comes to install them in November.</p>

<p> We moved on through Braunston Tunnel and to Norton Junction and Lower Heyford where we became celebrities at a film screening in the village hall. From there we continued to Northampton stopping at Bugbrooke for a look round.</p>

<p>We explored Northampton for a few days and were the only boat moored there for most of the time. Tony took the opportunity to fit an extra shelf in the TV cupboard and boot cupboard at the rear of the boat.</p>

<p>We had help on our way back to Gayton Junction from Leon, one of two homeless men who had tents by the canal. His friend was called Ian. Leon was very enthusiastic and got us through the locks very quickly.</p>

<p>Back in the summer Tony had ordered some new garage doors so we knew we had to get back to the house to take delivery and fit them. While travelling Tony had a phone call explaining that one of the workers had fallen off a lorry and injured himself so the delivery would be delayed.</p>

<p>So now, we have to plan for our Sofa Bed delivery, the solar panel fitting and the garage door delivery. We need to be in suitable places, sometimes needing access to a railway station, sometmes needing access to a road!</p>

<p>On our way moving slowly back to Norton where we are hoping for the sofa bed delivery we stopped to look round Brockhall. We had touble getting information about when our sofa would be delivered so decided to move on as we needed to get through a lock closing at Napton.</p>

<p>We made our way to Braunston where we had our first really cold morning with icicles on the inside of the windows.</p>

<p>We had also made a plan on for Joe and Kirsty to have the boat on the Llanollen Canal over Christmas as we thought this would be a nice place to be.</p>

<p>The logistics were getting very complicated!</p>


<h2>November 2018</h2>

<p>This was a month of complicated logistics so we could not relax.</p>

<p>We moved on from Braunston and stopped at Lower Shuckburgh which looked like a good place to stop for walks when we have time. While here Tony phoned up about the sofa bed. After some delaying and phoning back we were told that the sofa had been delivered to the Southampton store and then lost! It was eventually found and a delivery arranged for the following week. At last a little bit of certainty - we have dates for the sofa bed, the garage doors and the solar panel installation!</p>

<p>Joe and Kirsty wanted to use the boat while we were away from it at Christmas and we had hoped to let them have it on the Llangollen  canal - very pretty and with the advantage of decent towns with pubs and restaurants. But we had checked on the winter closures and discovered that we could not get through Birmingham for several months.</p>
 
<p>So, our plans had to change. They could have the boat at Oxford and we could pick up the sofa bed somewhere on the way.</p>

<p>One of the locks at Napton was due to close for repair so we had to travel fairly quickly to get there before it closed. We would be confined to the Oxford Canal for the winter but when we got our license for the River Thames in January we could go down the Thames on our way to visit Cathy in Bristol.</p>

<p>We managed to get to Napton before the lock closure where we discovered the lovely pub 'The Folly'. It was full when we arrived but more and more people arrived and they were all accommodated. We then moved on to Marston Doles where Tony returned to the house by bus and train and delivered the sofa bed to the boat by hire van. After returning the van at Eastleigh Tony travelled back on the train and bus.</p>

<p>We decided that Cropredy would be a good place to have the solar panels installed so cruised on to there stopping at Fenny Compton where we took part in the 100 year anniversary of the end of the First World War and explored the village of Wormleighton.</p>

<p>Cropredy was a lovely little village with a nice pub the 'Brasenose Arms'. We saw some very obvious ridge and furrow field systems on our way and we have become accustomed to seeing these in the fields in this area.</p>

<p>Our new solar panels were installed but we are puzzling over why the voltages in the cabin are lower than the voltages measured by the solar panel meter (tim-o-meter).</p>

<p>Then we moved on to Banbury where another closure was due. We spent a few days exploring Banbury which we both liked. It has a nice mix of modern shops, old streets with smaller shops and a few interesting buildings.</p>

<p>We went home from Banbury to receive and fit the garage doors and sadly Tarka became ill and was put down while we were at home.</p>

<h2>December 2018</h2>

<p>So, now we have dealt with the sofa bed delivery, the new garage doors and the solar panel installation! We only needed to find somewhere for Joe and Kirsty to pick up the boat at Christmas. So we cruised towards Oxford stopping at various places on the way.</p>

<p>King's Sutton, with its tall church spire, is visible for miles around and because of the winding of the canal apparently in different direction each time you see it.</p>

<p>While we were at home Rachel had made a curtain to be hooked up at the back of the bedroom to reduce the draughts which come through the many vents on the boat and Tony had made wooden brackets for it. We tried it out but it will need some modifications before it fits properly.</p>

<p>We have had problems with condensation forming under the bed's mattress so each day we lift the mattress and prop it up to be aired. While in Banbury Tony bought some wood and while moored in King's Sutton he made a slatted base to the bed to replace the solid MDF ones. This allows the mattress to air each day without having to lift it each day and is a major improvement to our day to day life!</p>

<p>The solar panels still didn't seem to be charging the batteries as expected and the fridge was refusing to run properly. Tony decided to try to get an engineer to look the wiring to see what was wrong and hoped to get the boat serviced as it was well overdue and he didn't know how to do it himself. However the boatyard at Aynho had no slots available this side of Christmas.</p>

<p>Tony eventually diagnosed that the panels had been wired to charge the starter battery rather than the domestic batteries. Tim had assumed that the three batteries located next to each other were the three domestic batteries and that the seperate one was the starter battery. But, in fact, it looks like previous owners added an extra domestic battery at some point and added that one at the end rather than locating it with the others.</p>

<p>Emailed photos to Tim, who spends his winters in India, confirmed Tony's diagnosis and he was able to reconnect the solar panel circuit to the correct battery.</p>

<p>We had our first breakdown, which was the same problem that Robin had experienced. One of the engine cooling hoses is a bit too short and therefore under tension so engine vibrations eventually cause the pipe  to pop off the end. Tony started periodically checking that the pipe was secure and the treat of another breakdown was a constant 'worry'.</p> 

<p>On our way to Oxford we explored Upper and Lower Heyford, Kirtlington and stopped one evening as it was getting dark, precariously on a slight bend at Shipton-on-Cherwell.</p>

<p>The next day we reached Thrupp, a lovely location! It is a tiny village with two pubs and a lovely basin where the canal turns next to a lift bridge. We thought this might be a good place for Joe and Kirsty to start their Christmas cruise. The very friendly warden also said that there is parking available for when Joe comes at Christmas and that if that is full he can park in the warden parking area.</p>
<p>We carried on towards Oxford until we reached Dukes Lock. However there was a warning at the lock that the only winding point beyond is the River Thames and we were unsure if we would be allowed to use the river without a license. So we turned round at the junction with some difficulty in the increasing wind.</p>

<p>After a short stay we moved back to Thrupp and moored up for Joe and Kirsty to find at Christmas. We also booked a Christmas Day meal in the 'Jolly Boatman' having investigated possibilities there and at the 'Boat Inn' in the village.</p>

<p>Our fridge is still not working properly. Tony investigated and with the help of the internet discovered that the wiring to the fridge is probably undersized.</p>

<p>We went home from Thrupp by bus and train and spent a few days over Christmas with Cathy and Will with Mary in Bristol. We also met Will's mum there. </p>

<p>Meawhile plans had been made for a family meet up in Newbury for Mary's 80th birthday and a table in a pub was booked. Once we get our Gold license in January we will travel down the River Thames onto the Kennet and Avon canal and have everyone on board for tea and cake, which Mary has baked, after the pub lunch.</p>

<h2>January 2019</h2>

<p>Joe and Kirsty had left the boat in Banbury and while at home Tony had made some bookcases from some oak faced MDF and had parcelled them up ready to take back to the boat on the train. Then Joe decided to come up for the weekend and despite his car breaking down Tony was able to wait for the breakdown man to come and fix it while Joe was at work. So Joe was able to bring all our heavy bits in the car after we had returned to the boat on the train.<p>

<p>While Joe was on board we cruised to Cropredy and back and had a meal in the 'Brasenose Arms'.</p>

<p>We were pleased when Tony installed the bookcases because rather than making the boat look bitty they make it look better with bookcases all along the wall.</p>

<p>Also while at home Tony printed off a map of the canal network for Rachel to use a a pattern for an embroidered map which she plans to make of our route.</p>


<p>We discovered a flaw in our plan to travel down the Thames and onto the Kennet and Avon Canal. It had not occurred to us that the closures on the River would be reported seperately from the canal closures and we discovered that a lock on the Thames was closed. So we had to abandon our plan for a family gathering for Mary's birthday on the boat in Newbury.</p>

<p>We explored Banbury for several days, visiting the aviary and doing a few short walks. Tony also booked a couple of Boat and Engine mantenance courses from the River Canal Rescue organisation.</p>

<p>We still needed to travel to Newbury in February for Mary's birthday meal, so we decided to travel to Oxford again with a little more time to stop off on the way. Oxford would be a convenient place to travel home</p>

<p>We stopped at Adderbury, a lovely place with lovely collections of houses nestled together and a small area with lakes to walk around.</p>

<p>Then off to Aynho. From there we walked into Clifton and followed the Deddington Circular Walk. While on this walk Cathy phoned to see if she could come to visit.</p>

<p>Next we stopped at Kirtlington and had time to explore the quarry. We ended up stopping at Thrupp again to await Cathy and Will's visit.</p>

<p>While waiting we had an unexpected visit from Robin so we visited both pubs for lunch and beer.</p>

<p>With Cathy and Will on board we cruised to Oxford and back over a couple of days. We ventured onto the River Thames briefly and did a small loop. When we got back to Thrupp we had a snow storm but we managed to walk to Annie's Tea room for tea and cake!</p>

<p>From Thrupp we walked into Kidlington across the fields. When we left Thrupp the canal was frozen and we went ice-breaking. Rachel attempting to push me off was the first indication that steering would be tricky in the ice. Turning to moor for water was also tricky. The boat doesn't want to go sideways due to the push-back from the ice. The water point was frozen but we managed to defrost it with water from the warm tap using the dog bowl provided! We carried on often having to steer the boat in a zig zag to break the ice while maintaining control. Watching the huge sheets of broken ice, sometimes 20 feet across shimmering as they broke and vibrated was lovely. Overall it was a little stressful with the worry of hitting moored boats but it was all ok in the end. We moored up just before Pigeon Lock at Kirtlington.</p>

<p>While there we had a walk into Tackley, a lovely path sometimes near the River Cherwell which had a lovely community shop.</p>

<p>We moved on to Aynho Wharf stopping to visit Somerton church - the one with the tall spire. From there we did the Deddington Circular Walk again and had a bizarre experience trying to get a cuppa in the Deddington Hotel.</p>

<p>We decided to try to get to Banbury where we need to be to collect a hire car so we can travel home. The weather forecast for the next few days includes wind and ice and we don't want to cruise in thick ice.</p>

<p>As we were there earlier than expected we were able to do the Banbury Fringe Walk which is about 10 miles.</p>

<p>Finally we collected our hire car and travelled home.</p>

<p>After our family gathering in Newbury for Mary's birthday we returned to the boat in our hire car.</p>

<p>While at home I had bought a small printer hoping to use it on the boat to print out maps for walking.</p>

<p>We set off into central Banbury and I booked a man to service our fire extinguishers. We had to stay a few days until he came and stayed a few days after as I had to attend my Engine Servicing classroom course in Stafford. Rachel and I went by train and stayed overnight in a Travelodge there.</p>

<p>While we were waiting in Banbury I installed some USB sockets above the dinette and in the bedroom.</p>

<p>I had problems buying filters for the engine. Ones that claimed to be compatible with the current ones were not.</p>

<p>We had two sets of visitors planning to visit us in Cropredy so we set off for there. We cruised a few miles North and back with each of our visitors.</p>

<p>We had decided that as the River Thames was not yet an option we needed to find somewhere else to go. We discovered that we could go to Nottingham! So after our visitors had left we moved on stopping at Claydon and Priors Hardwick where we had walks.</p>

<p>Due to a misunderstanding we thought we might be able to meet up with Garry and Helen in Bath when they visit Molly in Bath at Easter and we wanted to have Mary on board to visit Cathy in Bristol so we did some planning. We decided we should be able to do this after Nottingham. We also decided that we should go to Higher Moor in June from Leamington Spa rather than Yorkshire as this seemed more achievable. Once we had done our planning we realised our misunderstanding!</p>

<p>At Napton we again visited the 'Folly Inn' where we met a lovely Border Terrier puppy called Rex, reminiscent of Tarka when she was that age. Full of life and enthusiasm.</p>

<p>We moved on to Braunston where Robin joined us for the weekend. He accompanied us through Watford locks, where it was nice to see lambs in the field, and he went home from there. We passed through Crick almost exactly 6 months since we picked up Liberty Belle at the start of our adventures.</p>

<p>We stopped at Yelvertoft where we visited the deli called Squisito where we saw a sausage making lesson in progress and then mooored in Welford at the end of the arm. We had a bit of a mishap in Husbands Bosworth Tunnel where I misjudged the distance to an oncoming boat which did not move over enough and we scratched some paintwork and woodwork.</p>

<p>The weather was lovely as we cruise to Foxton Locks. So lovely that we had record temperatures for winter and an ice cream! We carried on to Market Harborough where we spent a day exploring the museum and library, with its corset exhibition, and set off in the evening for Debdale.</p>

<p>Robin tracked us down for a lunchtime cuppa at Newton Harcourt, after a job in Nottingham. Despite Newton Harcourt being an alleged beauty spot we could find nothing much to see so we set off again to do the remaining 7 locks to Kilby Bridge morring opposite the slightly unsightly wharf.</p>

<p>We made it to Leicester and then to Loughborough where we were trapped between two stretches of river in flood.</p>

<p>When the river opened we set off south again trying to get back to the River Thames as soon as possible as we had plans to go to Bristol as soon as the lock on the Thames was open.</p>

<p>On our way we had a request from Joe to meet up to do some work converting his new van to a camper van. We made our way quickly to Norton Junction as we knew where he could park and work on the van.</p>

<p>We then moved on and got all the way to Banbury where we planned to travel home.

<p>After some time spent at home we returned to the boat at Banbury and set off with plans to go on the River Thames to the Kennet and Avon Canal to Bristol.</p>

<p>We managed this, collecting Mary at Bath and met up with Cathy. After three days on Bristol Cathy came back to Bath with us.</p>

<p>Mary left us at Bradford on Avon and we carried on back along the Kennet and Avon Canal, onto the River Thames at Reading.</p>

<p>We cruised the Thames to Brentford and the joined the Grand Union Canal and took the Paddington Arm. We stayed in Paddington for a full week sightseeing.</p>

<p>We left Paddington and cruised the Regents Canal and then did a small loop to Limehouse, along the Limehouse Cut and back to the Regents Canal along a short stretch of the Hertford Union Canal.</p>

<p>We then needed to get to Leamington Spa where we plannedto moor while we got atrain to Cornwall to camp with friends.<p>

<p>So, back along the Regents Canal,the Paddington Arm of the Grand Union Canal back to the Grand Union Canal.</p>

<p>We found time to do the Wendover Arm near Tring and Aylesbury Arm before heading to Milton Keynes where Cathy joined as for a weekend cruising to Norton Junction.</p>

<p>Our route continued through Braunston and Napton Junction until we reached Leamington Spa where we left Liberty Belle for a couple of weeks.</p>

<p>On returning to Liberty Belle after of spell in Cornwall we wanted to get to Yorkshire fairly quickly fearing that the Yorkshire canals would close due to lack of water as happened last year.</p>

<p>So we followed the Grand Union to Birmingham and Salford Junction and then joined the Birmingham and Fazeley canal. At Fazeley Junction we turned onto the Coventry Canal and headed fro Fradley Junction.</p>

<p>The Trent and Mersey Canal took us to Lichfied, Rugeley, Great Haywood, Stone and Stoke on Trent to Newcastle under lyme and kidsgrove.</p>

<p>We joined the Macclesfield Canal and travelled through Congleton, Macclesfield and Bollington to Marple.</p>

<p>At Ashton-under-Lyne a short stretch of the Ashton Canal took us to Manchester.</p>

<p>We followed the Rochdale Canal to Littleborough.</p>

<p>Our travels round Yorkshire and Lancashire took us alomg the Rochdale Canal and the Calder and Hebble Navigation to Todmorden, Hebden Bridge, Sowerby Bridge, Elland, near Halifax, Brighouse and Wakefield.</p>

<p>This was followed by a spell on the Aire and Calder Navigation to Castleford and then on to Leeds where we joined the Leeds and Liverpool Canal.</p>

<p>We continued to Saltaire, through the Bingley locks to Silsden, and one of our favourites, Skipton.</p>

<p>We completed the month by travelling through Gargrave to Barnoldswick.</p>

<h2>September 2019</h2>

<p>We were now on a mission to reach Liverpool to collect Mary for a cruise to Chester.</p>

<p>The Leeds and Liverpool Canal through Burnley and Blackburn was horrendous with shallow and weedy stretches which resulted in Liberty Belle damaging her propeller.</p>

<p>Our journey through Chorley and Wigan was better though the damaged propeller made the journey less restfull with a juddering rudder. We didn't have to option of booking in to a boatyard for repairs as we had to get to Liverpool on time.</p>

<p>We passed by the Lancaster Canal as we didn't have time to explore there but carried on with haste to Liverpool where we had a booking for a specifc date. The last few miles on the canal were slow due to the shallowness and the wind made it tricky.</p>

<p>After a few days in Liverpool we retraced our path to Wigan and followed the Bridgewater Canal to Worsley and the outskirts of Manchester. We passed tghrough Sale which was a surprisingly nice modern town. We joined the Trent and Mersly Canbal at Preston Brook and took a brief trip on the Anfderton Boat Lift onto the River Weaver and back.</p>

<p>We continued through the more bleak lansdscape near Northwich to the prettier Maddlewich. Here we went along the shprtest of Britains canals, the Wardle Canal, only a few yards long bridging the gap to the Shropshire Union Canal (Middlewich Branch).</p>

<p>The Shropshire Union Canal then took us past Beeston Castle and into Chester.</p>

<p>After Mary left for home we had a quick trip to Ellesmere Port and back to Chester and then started our return along the Shropshire Union with a plan to visit the Lllangollen Canal.</p>

<h2>October 2019</h2>

<p>We set off through the narow lock at Hurlston and then through Whitchurch to Ellesmere. We had done this trip on a hire boat shortly before we bought our boat so did not hang about.</p>

<p>We made it to Chirk and then over the Pontcysyllte Aqueduct onto the last stretch down to Lllangollen. We were a little concerned that the canal might be too shallow for us as the draught of Liberty Belle was listed as greater than that recommended for this part of the canal. But all went well and when we measured our draught using the boat hook it seems that it wasn't as big as we thought.</p>

<p>After a few days we headed back, stopping this time to do the short Prees Branch and the longer, more rural Mongomery Canal.</p>

<p>Next we visited Nantwich, Liberty Belle's home town and up the Audlem and Adderley locks to Market Drayton.</p>

<p>We passed through Tyrley locks,Norbury Junction and Gnosall Heath to Wheaton Aston where we had a short delay due to a lock closure and then on to Brewood and Autherley Junction where the long flight of 21 locks to Wolverhampton started.</p>

<p>We spent the night moored outside the lovely Black Country Museum and then headed into the city where we moored in Cambrian Wharf in central Birmimgham.</p>

<p>We travelled home and spent some time doing some jobs.</p>

<h2>November 2019</h2>

<p>We had a lot of things to bring to the boat, including windlass storage that Tony had made while at home, and a hire car was a reasonably cheap option.</p>

<p>I took the opportunity to take my broken inverter back to the manufacturer at Droitwich on the way.</p>

<p>We needed to get the boat booked in to replace the propeller which we damaged back in September. Tony managed to boook her in for the start of December in Brinklow.</p>

<p>We decided to spend the intervening time exploring the Birmingham Canal Navigations. (BCN) These turned out to be mostly uninteresting and frequenlty shallow so it was not a particularly pleasant experience. It took a bit of plannimg to try to visit all the canals.</p>

<p>We then stayed at the Black Country Museum and had a good day in the museum and did the Dudley Tunnels boat trip.</p>

<p>We finished off some more of the BCN and then made our way via Birmingham, Fazeley and Nuneaton to Hawkesbury Junction on our way to the boat yard.</p>

<h2>December 2019</h2>

<p>We dropped off the boat at the boatyard and made our way home while it was being repaired. We had a hire car for this. Over a week later we returned to the repaired boat and made a plan to get the boat somewhere safe for Christmas. There were a couple of winter lock closures, one before Christmas and one after so we had to he careful gthat we were in the right place. The safest option would be to get as far as Berkhamstead but we decided to just go as far as Tring and go home a bit earlier. We had to be sure we would have time to get to Berkhamstead in early January.</p>

<p>So we made a fairly quick trip down to Marsworth where we could walk to Tring station to get home. When we traveled up this canal earlier in the year we had decided that this would be a good place to spend the winter and explore the towns nearby. But, because we spent time doing the BCN and getting the boat repaired this was not possible.</p>

<h2>January 2020</h2>

<p>After our rushing about before Christmas we were able to relax a bit when we returned to the boat after Christmas. We had to get to Berkhamstead because of the threatened closure but this was, in fact, delayed.</p>

<p>We were able to spend some time in Berkhamstead and did some walks and exploring. We then moved on to Hemel Hempstead which we also explored and did some walking in the area.</p>

<p>Joe needed to come up to work in London for a day so we needed to find somewhere for him to visit and be able to get a train into London. He came with his dog Carter and we looked after him while Joe was at work.<p>

<p>We then stopped at Cassiobury and spent time there explorng the local area and Watford. We moved on to Stockers Lock and visited Rickmansworth and Harefield.<p>

<p>We managed to do plenty of walks along this stretch.</p>

<p>We had decided to do the River Lee and the River Stort before heading to the Basingstoke Canal for the end of March when it reopens after the winter.</p>

<p>Joe wanted to come up for a week and work on the boat or in London at the beginning of February and both Joe and Kirsty wanted to join us for Half Term week either in London or on the River Lee.</p>

<p>So we started to make a plan. We didn't want to get to Paddington too early so decided to go to Brentford as there are good facilities there and railway stations.</p>

<p>In passing we did the Slough arm which was more pleasant than we expected though we avoided the really shallow end of the canal.</p>

<h2>February 2020</h2>

<p>After a few days in Brentford, Joe joined us. We stayed in Brenford for a while and then made our way to Greenford where Joe eventually left us</p>

<p>We rode out Storm Ciara in Greenford and then moved on to Paddington where we had trouble accessing our booked moorings.</p>

<p>We spent a few days exploring London from our mooringsin Paddington until Joe and Kirsty came. After a couple more days there we set off towards the River Lee. Joe worked on the boat most days and we made our way to Hertford via Hackney Marshes, Waltham Abbey and Broxbourne. The top end of the River Lee was lovely.</p>

<p>We spent several days at Hertford and then headed home on the train for over a week. While there Tony did his VHF radio course ready for our plan to go through central London on the Thames.</p>

<h2>March 2020</h2>

<p>We spent a little longer in Hertford and, after servicing the boat headed back down the River Lee stopping at Ware for a few days where we managed a few walks.</p>

<p>Our next stop was the junction of the River Lee and the River Stort. While there Cathy phoned to see if she could come to stay for a while and we decided it was best if she planned to meet us at Bishops Stortford knowing that if we didn't make it there on time there were other railway stations on the way.</p>

<p>Before starting the River Stort, we retraced our steps to buy diesel and coal as we were running too low and with a guest on board we wanted it to be cosy.</p>

<p>On our way to Bishops Stortford we stopped at Roydon Mill and Sawbridgeworth.</p>

<p>By the time Cathy joined us were seeing the first signs of panic buying in the supermarkets beause of the Coronavirus panademic which was starting. Very soon we were being advised to stay indoors.</p>

<p> On our way back down the river we stopped near Sawbridgeworth and at Harlow where we had our last trip to a coffee shop before the lock down.</p>

<p>Because Cathy was on board we hatched a plan to do the Thames through London on the following Sunday. The weather forcast looked good apart from the winds which were actually stronger than predicted on the few days before. We stopped at Broxbourne and Alfie's lock before making our way to Limehouse via the Olympic Park.</p>

<p>Our trip through London was fairly quite and took about 5 hours from Limehouse to Kingston. The next day Cathy left us and we were forced to move on the following day as we had run out of water.</p>

<p>We were hoping to move slowly enough to get to the Basingstoke Canal when it was due to open at the end of the month.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Tony checked  up on the River Wey and Basingstoke canal. The Wey is only open to Guildford and the Basingstoke Canal is still closed until at least the end of the month. So we have decided to travel to Oxford as a convenient place to moor should we need to go home due to the Coronavirus pandemic.</p>

<p>We set off went through the lock at Hampton where the facilties were but as we were heading for Sunbury Lock another boater shouted out to us that Sunbury Lock was closed due to a sunken boat and we should moor up in the channel towards the weir where we would not be moved on.</p>

<p>Once we had moored #Tony checked for closures on the River Thames. This had been on Tony's list of things to do for at least a week and he had not learnt his lesson from last year! The water is a bit high on many parts of the Thames. There are several locks closed until the end of the month. It looked like the sunken boat wasn't going to be moved any time soon!</p>

<p>Soon after mooring at Sunbury we were being advised to limit our movement to essential trips only. We are expecting to be here many weeks.</p>

<p>We have lovely safe moorings with good views out the windows but opprtunities for walking are limited. We are on the wrong side of the river so it is a half hour walk along dull roads to the towpath from where we can walk in either direction. Alternatively we can walk along the road to Hampton Court.<p>

<p>We have access to a small local supermarket and a larger Tesco about 40 minutes away. Fortunately we have enough diesel and gas for the time being and we can travel back a couple of miles and turn at the other side of the lock when we need water or toilet emptying.</p>
