&lt;h2&gt;4th - 13th November 2019&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n65/IMG-20191020-WA0003.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Liberty Belle moored alongside other residential boats at a wide wharf&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Liberty Belle moored in Cambrian Wharf.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;(Straight ahead is the Birmingham Arena)&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n65/IMG-20191108-WA0002.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Inside the back door of Liberty Belle are two matching shelves holding a pair of windlasses and a pair of mooring spikes.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Tony made us new windlass &amp;amp; mooring pin holders.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Posh.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After getting a few jobs done at the house, we returned to Birmingham, dropping off the faulty inverter on the way. Having already been moored for our 14 day allocation, we were ready to move Liberty Belle straight away and make room for another boat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we arrived we noticed that the other 14 day moorings were empty, so there certainly wasn't a queue! Tony contacted the Canal &amp;amp; River Trust to see whether they would allow us to stay until we had our inverter back from the repairers. They were agreeable, which meant Tony could easily travel by train to collect it. Fab!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, whilst we waited, we had a good look around the building site which is Birmingham City Centre. We do love Birmingham but it is surrounded by hoardings, scaffolding and apologies! I overheard someone saying that to get anywhere in Birmingham you have to go the long way round. That is so true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alongside exploring churches and museums, the Central Library and Botanic Gardens we were there to witness the switching on of the Christmas lights and the start of the German Christmas market, as well as the Remembrance Sunday Parade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year we attended a  Remembrance Sunday service around a village memorial, which was a small and very personal affair. This year, in the middle of a city, it was on a much larger scale and very formal. Very different and yet the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also included the occasional trip to the Briar Rose (our nearest Wetherspoons), The Wellington Specialist Real Ale Pub (of course) and the Damascena Coffee House, (my personal favourite).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n65/IMG-20191107-WA0006x.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The German Christmas Market with decorated and illuminated wooden huts selling goodies.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n65/IMG-20191107-WA0014.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A tall illuminated Christmas Tree constructed from smaller trees mounted on a frame.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The Christmas tree is actually a pile of small trees.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Cunning.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n65/IMG_20191106_124801121.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The whole entrance to the ICC has been removed.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The ICC is having a facelift.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;They seem to be going back to the bone!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n65/IMG_20191106_125613374.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Lots of building materials stashed behind hordings beside the museum.&quot; /&gt;

 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n65/IMG_20191106_130128871_HDR.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A colourful garden has been built on the terrace of the library.&quot; /&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst we were here, Tony also took the opportunity to try and book Liberty Belle into a boatyard to have her propeller fixed. He chose a convenient boatyard and contacted the number. After some confusing phone calls where he was sent around from one phone number to another until he came full circle, he tried another boatyard. Here he had more success. Now that we had a date we could plan our next few weeks of travel. We decided we had enough time to explore the Birmingham Canals before heading for the Coventry area for Liberty Belle's dry-dock booking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having had the call to say our inverter was ready for collection, Tony went by train to fetch it. It had been the switch that was broken. The nice engineer said there was no charge, so Tony handed him some beer money and both were happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once it was back in position and working, we were off. There is a very complicated network of canals around Birmingham and Tony had planned a route that would enable us to travel along most of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It felt good to be on the move again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Where Next?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are still chugging around Birmingham and will be heading to the boatyard in time for Liberty Belle's dry-dock 'appointment'.
We had hoped to have time to explore the Ashby Canal on the way but that will now have to wait until next year....&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rachel Glombek</name></author><category term="LibertyBelle" /><summary type="html">Birmingham 4th - 13th November 2019</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Good Ol’ Brummagem</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/libertybellenewsletter/libertybelle/2019/11/14/good-ol-brummagem.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Good Ol' Brummagem" /><published>2019-11-14T16:21:00+00:00</published><updated>2019-11-14T16:21:00+00:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/libertybellenewsletter/libertybelle/2019/11/14/good-ol-brummagem</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/libertybellenewsletter/libertybelle/2019/11/14/good-ol-brummagem.html">&lt;h2&gt;From Nantwich to Birmingham&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;14th - 23rd October 2019&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/maps/n64map.png&quot; alt=&quot;Our route&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Our route&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n64/P1270884.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A partially obscured sign reading 'Hack Green Secret Nuclear Bunker'&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Shhh...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Luckily the weeds have grown over this sign, otherwise everyone would know!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We left Nantwich on a misty autumn morning with lots of locks ahead of us. The canal was busy and so there was a lot of waiting around for Liberty Belle but it is always nice to chat at the locks and help each other through. It had been a long and tiring day and the sky began to look threatening before we arrived at our planned mooring. We tied up for the night before the last two locks on the Audlem flight, just in time for the rain to start!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the locks I had heard rumours of cake so, whilst Tony put the kettle on, I dashed up to the top of the flight to investigate. Sure enough I found a covered stall on a garden wall with various cakes, bagged up in pairs, a price list and an honesty box. What a wonderful idea. I chose lemon drizzle...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the way back I helped a single-handed boater through the last lock and passed on the information about cake. He was suitably excited about the news!  Then I took my treasure indoors before I got too wet!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We spent the evening in the Shroppie Fly pub, just a few locks down from our mooring and treated ourselves to a delicious meal. Apart from some lads playing pool in the other bar, we were the only customers. Considering the quality of the food, this seemed a real shame, but I suppose it was a school night...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;An unusual building at one of the Audlem locks.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Off the next day to Market Drayton, with plenty of locks to do again. We eagerly checked the cake stall as we passed by but were disappointed to find it empty. As we reached a bend in the canal we looked over our shoulders just in time to see an elderly gentleman carrying cake boxes to the stall. Noooooo, too late!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The canal was busy but the boats were well choreographed, one up, one down, one up, one down... Ideal!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We made it to Market Drayton in no time and looked for somewhere to tie up. We pulled over at some mooring rings and read the notice. Mooring was allowed on this stretch of the canal on market day and the day before, Wednesdays and Tuesdays....  We discussed this for an embarrassingly long time but came to the conclusion that it was Tuesday and so we tied up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n64/P1270951.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A colourful 'Welcome to Market Drayton' sign with pictures of buildings from the town, a kingfisher and a perch fish.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;A really delightful sign welcoming us.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n64/P1270952.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A Canal and River Trust sign reading 'Welcome to Market Drayton. Overnight mooring only Except for Tuesday &amp;amp; Wednesday (pre-market and market days), when daytime mooring is allowed.'&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;So, what day is it?&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n64/P1270955.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Liberty Belle mooring in daylight on a Tuesday!&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Our Tuesday mooring...!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to our early arrival at Market Drayton and the good weather that afternoon, we managed to service Liberty Belle's engine. Not only that, but the engine still seemed to work afterwards! We were pleased with ourselves until we discovered that the battery inverter, which provides 240V electricity for the TV and my hairdryer, no longer worked.  What on earth could we have done?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After much discussion and checking Tony managed to convince me that it must be a coincidence...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tony with a beard and me without a hairdryer, personal grooming is at an all-time low.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;On the way to find a supermarket in Market Drayton we discovered this...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;...and felt we should investigate.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;It was a good decision.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n64/IMG-20191015-WA0002.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A beermat describing the history of Joule's Ales&quot; /&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;So really, it was an educational visit.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following morning we set off in the autumn sunshine. We were travelling through a tunnel of trees, with insects busy in the shafts of sunlight and leaves falling all around us, catching the light as they tumbled. Beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then the hard work began, with some difficult locks. The advice for operating the Tyrley Flight is to keep the boat in the previous lock whilst setting the next, because of the strong sidewash across the front of each one. This way the boat can be driven at top speed towards the source of the sidewash which will then turn the bow towards the open lock gates....(If the boat is left to drift in the pound it will be too difficult to approach the next lock at the right angle.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The crew member thus needs to walk ahead, set the lock, open the gates, walk back to the previous lock, shut the gate, back to the current lock, shut the gate.....etc&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The locks were far enough apart to make this a slow, laborious process.
We also had a boat just in front of us, which meant we needed to empty each lock again before we could use it. The chap in front took pity on us and, when he could, after leaving the lock, he would wind up a paddle to start to drain it for us. This made life a lot easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The local rock obviously doesn't cut easily giving this tunnel entrance an interesting shape.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later in the day the battery warning light came on so we had to pull over and have a look. It seems, in our attempt to inspect and tighten the alternator belt we had, in fact, managed to loosen it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following morning,Tony replaced the alternator belt with one of his spares and all was well. (We have plenty of spares of everything for the engine because it is so difficult to buy them at a reasonable price when travelling around).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We then had a short journey into Wheaton Aston where we knew that one of the locks was being repaired and wasn't due to open until that afternoon. When we investigated, the workmen were obviously still busy and told us that it may take longer than forecast, possibly until the following afternoon, so we prepared to stay there for a day or maybe more...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A hire boat, that we had seen several times over the past couple of days, moored up behind us and were surprised to learn that the lock was closed for repair. We were shocked that the hire firm hadn't warned them, as it had been planned for some time. They were quite upbeat about it though and one of the women was actually pleased as it would give her a chance to have her hair done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst we waited we visited the village but there was very little to see. We checked the vegetable options in both shops and found we had a choice of cauliflower or.... cauliflower. We also looked for a hairdresser for our new friend but there wasn't one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the way back to the canal we met our boating neighbours and informed them that the village had just a Co-op and a Spar. The woman's eyes lit up! A Spa! Wonderful! Her dreams had come true.... We were a bit baffled then realised the mistake. No, no. A 'So-near-so-Spar', not a health spa. What a disappointment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it turned out the lock opened that evening but we stayed overnight and left first thing the following morning.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were both looking forward to being back in Brumm but first we had to get through the 21 locks at Wolverhampton. We thought these might be rather industrial and run down but were pleasantly surprised. They we all very neat, well kept and easy to operate. About half way up the set of locks we came across a busy work party hoeing, weeding, sweeping and rubbish picking. Wow! This was Wolverhampton's secret - a well supported community payback scheme!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most canals approaching cities are rather grim but around Birmingham there are many beautiful sections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Lock pride, that's what we like to see.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n64/IMG-20191019-WA0002.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Liberty Belle moored just over the fence from the museum.&quot; /&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Years of ropes cutting into the stone as the horses pulled their boats out of the lock.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We eventually arrived in Birmingham and found a 14 day mooring next to some residential boats and near the Canal &amp;amp; River Trust offices. We always feel safe in good ol' Brummagem, but this mooring felt especially so. We decided that we no longer needed to get to Leamington Spa before going back to the house as we were already in the ideal place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After getting a few jobs done and meeting up with Julia for a delightful lunch, we were fortunate enough to get a lift all the way back to the house where the garden was awaiting our attention...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Where Next?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tony has booked Liberty Belle into a boatyard near Coventry for the first week in December to have her propeller repaired. We will be heading back to the house whilst she is in the dry dock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime we are exploring the canals around Birmingham.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rachel Glombek</name></author><category term="LibertyBelle" /><summary type="html">From Nantwich to Birmingham 14th - 23rd October 2019</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Liberty Belle Visits Her Home Town</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/libertybellenewsletter/libertybelle/2019/11/07/liberty-belle-visits-her-home-town.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Liberty Belle Visits Her Home Town" /><published>2019-11-07T16:58:00+00:00</published><updated>2019-11-07T16:58:00+00:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/libertybellenewsletter/libertybelle/2019/11/07/liberty-belle-visits-her-home-town</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/libertybellenewsletter/libertybelle/2019/11/07/liberty-belle-visits-her-home-town.html">&lt;h2&gt;From Chester to Nantwich&lt;/h2&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Pretty Shropshire.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As September came to an end we began to see hips and haws in the hedgerows with crab apples and damsons in the trees above.
The leaves began to fall, the temperature began to drop and most days came with rain showers. We kept ourselves going with mugs of coffee and cocoa on the move.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tony decided to grow his beard to help keep him warm over winter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We still occasionally spotted sprigs of meadow sweet or a butterfly to remind us of the summer just gone.
(We were surprised to see some very young ducklings in the first week of October; I don't hold out much hope of them maturing in time for winter.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dodging the rain as much as possible we left Chester and headed for Wales. (Probably not the best place to go if you are trying to avoid the wet weather.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turning onto the Llangollen Canal we immediately entered the first of the Hurleston Locks which is rather narrow and needs careful handling, so it is manned by lock keepers. Liberty Belle was a tight fit, but we made it through without incident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a reservoir here at the bottom of the Hurleston Locks which is filled from the Llangollen canal. The water rushes past the locks through the overflows on its way to the reservoir, creating quite a strong current in front of the bottom gates. This makes the approach to the locks difficult. These locks were also hard to operate, so we both had a tiring day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once we had moored up we realised our phone signals were poor so we decided to go to the local pub to use their WiFi and get a bit more newsletter done. When we tried to access the WiFi we were informed that the local BT box had been involved in a traffic accident and so there was no WiFi to be had. We were advised to have a conversation...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n63/P1270373.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Liberty Belle approaching the entrance to a bridge over the Llangollen Canal.&quot; /&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;..and into the tight lock.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Another flight of locks! Grindley Brook&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the day we approached Ellesmere there were no locks to do but plenty of swing bridges which was just as well as I needed something to do to keep me warm. The canal was pretty enough but not very interesting except for the kingfishers and herons. We occasionally had a gap in the hedge through which we would see either a field of corn or cows. Ellesmere itself is a pleasant little place with cafes, useful shops and canal-side art.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n63/P1270427.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Rachel winding a lift bridge open as Liberty Belle approaches and an oncomimg boat waits by the towpath.&quot; /&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Instead of the usual black &amp;amp; white, this lift bridge was camouflaged.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Maybe the local smugglers hope we will crash into it in the fog so they can lay claim to our cargo!?!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;... or two..&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n63/DSCN3299.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Tony sitting in a stone, boat shaped shelter.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;...some more useful than others.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Leaving the little Ellesmere arm and heading for Llangollen.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Ellesmere the views became much more interesting and, in response, so did the canal. The complicated landscape required tunnels, embankments, locks, aqueducts and  viaducts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First we negotiated the Chirk tunnels. Neither of these is very long, as tunnels go, but they took us ages! We were going against the flow of water (to the reservoir) and, because Liberty Belle was a fairly tight fit, she had difficulty displacing the water. It seemed to take forever!. Thankfully there wasn't a queue of boats waiting to come through...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;A railway via-duck in the distance.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually we reached the famous Pontcysyllte Aqueduct. Tony went onto the tow path to take some photographs and I drove. Although I have been across it several times (in hire boats), I suddenly felt scared. I am not sure why but I seemed to talk myself into it somehow. I could feel my heart being squeezed. I knew logically that I was safe, but it was quite a weird sensation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Immediately after the aqueduct is a very tight turn under a bridge, so I handed over the tiller to the expert and corrected my breathing!
Before reaching Llangollen there are a couple of stretches of the canal which are not wide enough for boats to pass each other, so I went ahead on foot to make sure these sections were free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n63/P1270566.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Liberty Belle crossing the Pontcysyllte Aqueduct&quot; /&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;My view!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Gulp...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n63/P1270605.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Rachel standing in frony of one of the stone bridges on the way to Lllangollen.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Terra firma.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We made it to the moorings without incident and tied up in the best position; in the sunshine, as near to the town as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the background we could hear dogs barking and thought we must be moored near a boarding kennels...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Off we went to pay for 2 nights' mooring and discovered that the electric hook-up was included in the price! Perfect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suddenly dogs started to appear on the wooded slope on the opposite side of the canal. One jumped into the water, then another. They both tried to scrabble back onto the bank but the concrete side was too steep. I and another boater dashed over trying to encourage the dogs to the towpath side. One responded and I tried to grab it but it had no collar so I couldn't get a hold. The two dogs were now frantic, barking and scrabbling against the concrete sides. Other dogs jumped in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A man appeared on the wooded bank, and we assumed the dogs must be his. Tony moved Liberty Belle across the canal to pick him up and transport him to the tow path.  Once he was on the same side as us, all the rest of the dogs (there must have been a dozen all together) jumped into the canal trying to swim to him. Flippin' 'eck. More people tried to help but none of the dogs had collars... The only thing left to do was to get into the canal and help each dog out in turn. The owner agreed that it would probably come to that.... None of us volunteers felt prepared to get in water so we left him to get his own tweed suit wet. I assume he did just that. I don't suppose he looked quite so dapper in his country gentleman's outfit by the time he got home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it turned out that we were not opposite boarding kennels after all and were in a very quiet, as well as pretty and convenient mooring. After a walk to the end of the canal at Horseshoe Falls, out came the vacuum cleaner, the electric heater and our new electric kettle and we attempted to get our money's worth!&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;A passing steam train.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making good use of our two day mooring and the beautiful weather, we went for a walk to the castle ruins overlooking the town. Castell Dinas Bran, or Crow Castle, is a Medieval castle built on the site of an Iron Age hillfort. The walk was delightful and views were spectacular.
We decided to walk back via the Pontcysyllte Aqueduct and along the canal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the time we got to the canal, the weather had changed. It was too wet and windy to enjoy a walk over the aqueduct so we sheltered as well as we could and had a little picnic outside the visitors' centre. We were just in time to see a very small day-hire boat trying to negotiate the tight turn under the bridge heading for the aqueduct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The little boat had two men at the back and several passengers, most of them children. The helmsman was going at full speed and didn't seem to know how to steer. He smacked into the side of the canal, reversed without looking behind him, then went full speed forwards again, with the inevitable smack into the side. The children on the boat were screaming as they were thrown about. One of them was wearing another's hot chocolate drink all over the back of her coat. The men at the helm showed no concern whatsoever as they bashed and crashed their way about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nutters!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We left before we had to witness the crossing of the aqueduct...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We stopped off at a pub on the way back, grateful for some respite from the rain.
On our return we were pleased to see that the Nutters' hire boat wasn't embedded in the side of Liberty Belle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were moored in the last space before the hire company's moorings with a narrow bridge between. There was no sign of any damage, but I was glad I hadn't been there to witness them passing by!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After spending our couple of days exploring the area around Llangollen, we took Liberty Belle back the way we came. Back over the aqueduct (Tony at the helm), through Chirk tunnels (this time we were travelling with the flow, which made it easy).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n63/P1270675.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Tony driving Liberty Belle back across Chirck Aqueduct.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Back the way we came....&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n63/P1270685.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A blue sign reading 'Welcome to England'.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;...back into England&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time we had booked passage through the locks onto the Montgomery Arm and planned to explore the Prees Branch too on our way back to the Shropshire Union.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Montgomery Arm is being restored and is only navigable for the first 7 miles. The number of visitor boats allowed on the arm at any one time is limited to 12 and passage through the locks at the top of the arm has to be booked in advance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We moored at the top of the Montgomery Canal ready to go down the set of locks as soon as they opened at midday. As it happened, they were ready early and waved us in at 11:30.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Turning into the Montgomery Canal&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n63/P1270706.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A cast iron signpost reading 'Newtown 35 Miles, Welsh Frankton 0 Miles, Montgomery Canal'.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Are we back in Wales?&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n63/P1270707cropped2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A Canal and River Trust chalkboard reading 'Welcome to Frankton! Boats booked for passgae today. Down, Liberty Belle ....'&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;They are expecting us.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n63/P1270714.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Rachel standing behind a stone wall at the edge of the canal. The wall has a small gap spanned by a cast iron arch.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;An iron rail over a gap in the wall, to stop the horse's rope getting caught.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once through the locks the canal was uneventful. It was shallow, which made us slow, and had high hedges on both sides so there was not much to see. As we got nearer to the end of the navigable section of the canal, we came across a winding hole and decided to take the opportunity to turn, just in case the canal got any more difficult to navigate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was hard work, with me on the tiller revving and reversing and Tony with the barge pole shoving and heaving. With much churning of mud and weed we finally managed to turn and moored at the first opportunity. We then walked the final stretch of canal into town only to find it was the best bit! Oh well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walking back to Liberty Belle we noticed that a boat was straddling the canal. It was attached to the bank opposite the tow path with it's bow rope. It's stern rope had frayed right through allowing the boat to float freely across the canal. That was going to be tricky for the next boat to come along. Now we were glad that we hadn't brought Liberty Belle up this far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following morning we headed back to the start of the canal arm to arrive at the locks just as they opened at 12 and then turned back onto the main branch to Ellesmere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following day we took a diversion down the short Prees Arm, (which never did reach as far as Prees) to see the skew lift bridge highlighted in our guides. It was indeed skew although it wasn't clear why, as it didn't really line up with the track on either side. We bought a bottle of gas in the marina at the end of the arm, reversed out, turned and followed the arm back onto the main canal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We thought the Prees Branch was prettier than the Montgomery but at first we weren't sure why. We decided that, although both canals were lined with hedges, the ones on the Prees branch were set a little bit further back from the canal itself and were interspersed with various trees, so the heights, textures and colours made it more interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alongside the canal here is a nature reserve, consisting of peat bogs and lakes. Originally it was a battle to keep the canal sides from collapsing and joining the lake but in more recent years, steel piling has been used to create a firm edge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The skew lift bridge.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We continued on to Whitchurch, finally arriving in the dark. It was quite busy on the main canal so there was plenty of help at the locks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n63/P1270827.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Liberty Belle in a lock with several streams of water eminating from holes in the brick lock wall.&quot; /&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n63/P1270836.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Passing back through the narrowest lock under the watchfull eyes of the Canal and iver Trust staff.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The vigilant lock keepers at Hurleston Locks&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After squeezing back through the Hurleston locks under the watchful gaze of the lock keepers, we turned back onto the Shropshire Union Canal, heading this time for Nantwich. We arrived and found a mooring by the Nantwich Aqueduct, Liberty Belle's home 'ground'.
(We were a little bit concerned that the original owners would see her and demand to know what on earth we had done to their boat. Luckily we got away with it!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n63/P1270855.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A life-sized draft horse, leaning to take the strain, constructed from large old timbers, probably lock gates.&quot; /&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Isn't he something?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n63/P1270850.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A narrow boat called 'Liberty'&quot; /&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Where Next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This newsletter has been a long time coming, I know!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are currently in Birmingham waiting for our battery inverter to be fixed. We will then spend some time exploring the network of canals around the city before heading towards Milton Keynes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully we will be able to buy some coal on the way - it's getting a bit nippy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our plans are not very detailed yet as we need to book Liberty Belle in at a boatyard (somewhere) to have her propeller fixed and her bottom painted...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, watch this space.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rachel Glombek</name></author><category term="LibertyBelle" /><summary type="html">From Chester to Nantwich 30th September - 13th October 2019</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Wall-to-Wall Chester</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/libertybellenewsletter/libertybelle/2019/10/19/wall-to-wall-chester.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Wall-to-Wall Chester" /><published>2019-10-19T22:01:00+01:00</published><updated>2019-10-19T22:01:00+01:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/libertybellenewsletter/libertybelle/2019/10/19/wall-to-wall-chester</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/libertybellenewsletter/libertybelle/2019/10/19/wall-to-wall-chester.html">&lt;h2&gt;Chester and Ellesemere Port&lt;/h2&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Our route&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n62/DSCN3257.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Liberty Belle dwarfed beneath about a ten storey brick built mill.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Liberty Belle moored outside the former steam driven flour mill.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wow! Chester! Where do you begin? The Cathedral, Roman Amphitheatre, Castle, Roodee (?), city walls....?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The obvious thing to do first is to walk the city walls but the weather wasn't very nice when we arrived so we put that off until the following day when it was due to be fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we started by exploring the shops. But these are not just shops, they are the fascinating and decorative Medieval Rows. These buildings have shops a step or two below street level, then a second level of shops above these with steps up to them and a walkway along the front. This walkway is roofed by the storey above which juts out and is supported on pillars. These buildings stretch along both sides of four streets in the centre of Chester. Amazing! What more could you want on a rainy day?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sadly, as with most town centres at the moment, rather a lot of the shops were empty. They need to take a leaf out of Wigan's book...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n62/DSCN3221.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A view down one of Chester's streets of timber framed buildings from one of the gates in the walls.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Chester&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n62/DSCN3131.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;One of the timber frames shops in the Rows with a small stone stairway appended to the outside.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt; A set of steps up to the second storey in the Rows.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n62/DSCN3255.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;An elaborately decorated building with the words 'To God My King and My Country' carved on a lintel and statue of a king.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;An elaborate shop front. &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n62/DSCN3129.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Tony about to bump his head on one of the low beams in the upper storey of the Rows.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The Rows were clearly built with shorter people in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n62/DSCN3198.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Mary and Rachel beside a bronze scupture of a life-sized baby elephant.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Can we keep him, Tony?&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Can we?&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Pleeease?&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n62/P1270348.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;What appears to be a tall brick-built chimney but was in fact used for lead shot manufacture.&quot; /&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Chester's Shot Tower made lead shot for the Napoleonic Wars.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Molten lead, dripped from the top, forms a sphere on it's way down to the cooling water at the base.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Genius!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next was Chester's Cathedral. We joined a guided tour which was absolutely fascinating. The Cathedral was wonderful to look at but so much more wonderful when we had some of it explained. Here are just a few of the very many photos we took...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n62/DSCN3212.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Mary and Tony beside the railing of the Cathedral grounds.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The Cathedral.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n62/DSCN3214.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A tall, square, modern stone and tiled tower&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The Cathedral's bell tower, built when the main tower was declared no longer strong enough to bear the bells.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n62/DSCN3192.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Inside the cathedral - a Romanesque arch and a gothic arch with a series of small Romanesque arches above.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The little arches part way up the wall mark the original height of this bit of the cathedral and are held up by recycled Roman pillars.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n62/DSCN3195.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Tall narrow Gothic style windows with extra, vertical, fluted pillars on the inside which are braced to the window mullions.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Early Gothic windows.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The earliest.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;SO early that they weren't convinced they would be strong enough so they have strengthening pillars against the mullions.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n62/DSCN3159.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A Gothic style arch with a smaller scalloped arch beneath.&quot; /&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;A fancy arch.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n62/DSCN3182.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A picture of the Madonna and Child painted on a sheet of fabric made from insect cocoon fabric. It is illuminated by a light behind.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;A painting on a cobweb!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;(Well, some sort of cocoon fabric...)&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cathedral began as the abbey church of a Benedictine monastery. The quire stalls are elaborately carved with a misericord seat, each with a separate canopy above, for each of the 48 monks of the monastery. Apparently the subject of the carvings on the seats were not allowed to be taken from the Bible because it would have been disrespectful to sit on them, so mythical characters were used. Many carpenters were involved and each design had to be approved by the monastery before they were made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n62/DSCN3174.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A carved wooden elephant whose body resembles a horse, including hooves and a more realistic elephant head.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The Bishop's Courtroom.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That evening, Tony and I decided to go back to the Cathedral for Evensong. The atmosphere in a place of worship during a service adds another dimension to the building and it is just nice to appreciate the space when it is being used in the way it was intended. In a village church it can feel a bit intrusive but in a Cathedral it seems more appropriate. We enjoyed the experience very much, especially as we were directed to sit in the monks' seats behind the choir. The sad thing was that the congregation was outnumbered by those taking the service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following day we set off along Chester's City Walls. Begun by the Romans, updated in Medieval times and repaired regularly ever since, the two mile walk gives the perfect vantage point from which to view the City.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n62/DSCN3207.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Tony and Mary in front of a red sandstone tower, flat on the inside and round on the outside with stone steps leading up to a wooden door.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Walking the walls. A 13th Century tower...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n62/DSCN3224.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A more recent stone arch over a modern road with towers on either side.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;... and a modern gateway&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n62/DSCN3217.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;An ornate, colourfully painted, cast iron clock on an iron frame above the bridge across one of the roads in Chester.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n62/DSCN3234.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Two timber framed gables over a stone base wall form two houses. A sign on one reads 'SOP', the other 'SMP'&quot; /&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The signs on the front mark the boundary between two different parishes.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abutting the walls is Chester's Roodee Race Track. This area was a Roman port which became filled in with silt. Then it was used as a sports ground but in 1533 the football games became so violent that they were banned. They were replaced by horse racing by the consent of the Mayor of the time, Henry Gee, of gee-gee fame! Yes, it's true!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n62/DSCN3244cropped.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A truncated stone pillar on a low pedestal protrudes from the grassed area.&quot; /&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Despite the evidence I remain convinced that they race horses here, not rhinos.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On our way to Chester we had met a man who recommended the Telford's Warehouse pub. Our walk along the walls just happened to take us there at around lunch time, so we popped in and Mary treated us. Mmmm. The food was very good indeed, not to mention the beer. Thanks Mary!

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n62/P1270344.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The canalside Telford Warehouse consisting of a large rectangular building with a smaller gabled building attached. The smaller building has archways and an entrance over the water which allow a boat to move under the building for loading and unloading.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;An historic wharf building, now a pub.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n62/IMG-20190925-WA0005.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Mary behind a plate of yorkshire pudding filled with mashed potato and topped with three sausages.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Tony's dinner was big but not as massive as it looks in this photo!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As if all this wasn't enough, we popped into the Grosvenor museum where lots of Roman artifacts are displayed and, in the adjoining Number 20 Castle Street, there is a series of nine period rooms dating from 1680 to 1925.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having spent two weeks travelling on Liberty Belle, Mary took the train home from Chester. We kept her company on her first train, to Crewe. We wondered what Crewe would have to offer...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second breakfast, it turned out, in the form of Staffordshire Oat Cakes filled with a full English! This was a first for us but certainly not a last.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n62/IMG-20190926-WA0000.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Rachel inspecting the contents of a Staffordshire oatcake 'sandwich'&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Breakfast, the Staffordshire way!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two of us arrived back in Chester and sheltered from the rain in Chester's first Cathedral, St Johns. which was well worth a visit. We then had a closer look at the Roman amphitheatre and garden before returning to Liberty Belle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n62/DSCN3265.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Romanesque arches with a row of smaller arches above.&quot; /&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;St. John's.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n62/IMG-20190926-WA0004.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Rachel with a Dr Martens bag containing shoes!&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;A bit of shopping.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;New shoes?&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Oh yes!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mary must have known that the weather was about to take a real turn for the worse...my goodness we had a lot of rain over the next several days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We left Chester behind for a couple of days whilst we went to Ellesmere Port, where they have a Museum dedicated to canals, barges and narrow boats. We didn't know what to expect but it turned out to be fascinating. We spent a whole day there, dodging in and out of the buildings to avoid the heavy showers. There was technical information about canals, locks, bridges and boats as well as social history concerning navvies, boat builders, boaters and all the other people needed at the wharves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n62/DSCN3289.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A cast iron sign reading 'Ellesmere Port 0 Miles, Autherley Junction 66 1/2 Miles, Chester 9 Miles&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;0 Miles?&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;I guess we must be here then.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n62/IMG_20190928_124616.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Tony using an interactive display simulating the boat rocking required to break the ice on the canal.&quot; /&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;It must have been exhausting!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We spent the night moored in Ellesmere Port then made our way back to Chester. It was pouring with rain (again), so where better to sit it out than Telford's Warehouse...?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Where Next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are popping back to the house next week to get some jobs done...
Once we are re-united with Liberty Belle we will probably stay in the Midlands until we head for the Milton Keynes area for the winter.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rachel Glombek</name></author><category term="LibertyBelle" /><summary type="html">Chester and Ellesemere Port 23rd - 29th October 2019</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Mary’s Grand Tour</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/libertybellenewsletter/libertybelle/2019/10/17/marys-grand-tour.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Mary's Grand Tour" /><published>2019-10-17T17:36:00+01:00</published><updated>2019-10-17T17:36:00+01:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/libertybellenewsletter/libertybelle/2019/10/17/marys-grand-tour</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/libertybellenewsletter/libertybelle/2019/10/17/marys-grand-tour.html">&lt;h2&gt;From Liverpool to Chester&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;11th - 23rd September 2019&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n61/P1270064.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Mary and Rachel taking tea while seated on the towpath beside Liberty Belle&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Enjoying the September sunshine.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we were in Liverpool! This compact city snuggles right up to the docks, so we were ideally positioned for exploring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, before we could do any sightseeing, we had a few jobs to do in preparation for Mary's visit. Mainly laundry, shopping and housework (or boatwork).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our Salthouse Dock mooring we had free electric hook-up! So exciting!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We used Liberty Belle's vacuum cleaner for the first time to prepare the boat for our honoured guest and, because the overnight temperatures were beginning to feel rather autumnal, Tony bought an electric heater for the princely sum of £6, which worked a treat!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Laundry? There's an app for that!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a slightly complicated journey by train, Mary finally arrived in Liverpool to meet us. The weather was on our side so we spent the next couple of days exploring the city on foot and by open-top bus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We like Liverpool. It is a friendly, interesting and clean city which is busy and bustling without being cramped and has fascinating buildings, both ancient and modern, sitting harmoniously side by side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n61/DSCN2886.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A sculpture of a rearing horse. Its tail appears to be unravelling into a pile of rope on the ground.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;By standing on it's tail, the man is unravelling the horse into a pile of rope.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n61/DSCN2920.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Tony and Rachel stood in front of the larger than life-sized Beatles statue.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Here they come, walking down the street..!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Oh no, hang on, that's another lot.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We visited Liverpool's Catholic Cathedral which is truly a place of two contrasting halves! Its foundations were built to a traditional, vaulted design, but the construction was interrupted by war. By the time the building resumed they had a very different design, so above ground it is shockingly modern...!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the outside the Cathedral appears to promise a light, airy and colourful inside space but I was personally disappointed, finding it remarkably gloomy. I couldn't help comparing it to the Coventry Cathedral which I much prefer. However, the story of it's construction was fascinating and well presented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n61/DSCN2889.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;An external view of the cathedral looking like an upside down funnel.&quot; /&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n61/DSCN2899.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A view down a similar vault with interpretation boards.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The space is huge. The original plans for the Cathedral were, to say the least, dramatic.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We popped into Liverpool's Central Library as we were passing by. My goodness, this building is amazing! It is modern and traditional, calm and exciting. Tony and I both thought that we could live here just to have daily access to this place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The children's section is shaped like an amphitheatre, with steps all around, scattered with bean bags and a stage in the middle. When we were there a little girl was performing ballet moves on the stage for her mother's entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hushed Reading Room has beautiful wooden bookcases with steps and walkways to give access to the higher shelves. The lobby, oh my goodness, is modern and wonderful with escalators zig-zagging into the sky above your head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n61/DSCN2932.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The honey oak library shelves radiate out in the large circular room. The shelves extend to a second floor.&quot; /&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Strawberry Fields forever!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two days wasn't long enough to do justice to the lovely Liverpool, but we had other plans...

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n61/DSCN2945.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Looking back towards Liverpool between the modern buildings around the docks.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Goodbye Liverpool.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n61/DSCN2953.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Liberty Belle moving slowly alongside another boat between two locks on the way out of Liverpool.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Sharing the locks out of Liverpool in the drizzle.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were looking forward to Chester but that was nearly 2 weeks away. In the meantime we had the excitement of tunnels and swing bridges, the surprisingly lovely Wigan, the free bits of the Dunham Massey Hall and the amazing Anderton Boat Lift.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In between these wonders Mum and I walked the towpath for exercise for a while each day and then sat in the bow watching for kingfishers and other wildlife. We even saw a turtle basking in the sunshine on a log.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n61/DSCN2965.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The windmill art gallery at Parbold with a crenellated top and no domed roof.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;We stopped off in Par-boiled, but the Windmill Gallery was closed. Typical.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n61/P1260965.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A partly open, rusty swing bridge with bushes growing on it.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;A swing bridge returning to nature...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We gingerly moored up in Wigan to have a look around. We set off to find the town and weren't quite sure of the route. We stopped two young lads and asked them. They were friendly and helpful despite being a little confused as they couldn't think what we could possibly see there!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually, we were pleasantly surprised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new shopping arcades in the town have been tastefully built to blend in with the old buildings. The library/museum was welcoming and interesting; we certainly couldn't fault the enthusiasm of the staff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The town is trying very hard to envelop the residents in arts projects. The people of Wigan have collaborated to create a manifesto entitled 'The Fire Within' which is an attempt to boost local culture, bring life back to the town centre and encourage local talent. Some empty shops are being used as galleries to display artefacts from the museum's collections as well as projects from local clubs and schools. Other unused units are now performance space for local groups and individuals to show off their talents in front of their family, friends, neighbours and visitors. Poetry recitals, dance, music, theatre all take place in the arcade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result of all these events, a local family have been able to open a successful new cafe in one of the empty spaces, providing refreshments for all the visitors. Go Wigan!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;A slightly more famous visitor to Wigan.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On our way we found a pretty mooring space opposite a lake. This turned out to be the Pennington Flash Country Park, created by subsidence after the collapse of salt mines in the area. These 'flashes' seem to be scattered all over the landscape around here.
Along the canal there are unexpectedly wide sections created the same way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Flashes, or lakes, are now used for local leisure and wildlife. There are well kept footpaths and seating areas around the park and plenty of waterfowl to watch. According to the two local men we met on a walk around the lake, there is also a well used hide nearby where birds are fed regularly and provide a good show. We stood with them for a while watching the many cormorants and Great Crested Grebes on the lake. Apparently they are the reason the men no longer fish here, they cannot compete!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 1720's the Worsley coal mines used underground water channels to drain the mines and transport the coal on long, narrow boats out into the open. With the rise in demand for coal in Manchester, these 'navigations' were extended and the resulting Bridgewater Canal was opened in 1761. It was the first canal which did not follow the course of an existing river and was fed by the drainage water from the mines. This is where it all began!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is still privately owned and has its own solution to keeping the canal clear of rubbish, a boat called the Waterwomble, which patrols the canal, lifting out anything undesirable as it goes for either recycling or disposal. We asked in passing where the nearest rubbish collection point was and they told us to just sling our rubbish bag on-board, which we did! What service!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Bridgewater canal has no locks because it follows the contours of the land which made the life of Liberty Belle's crew rather easy. It has other distinctive features including regular gates set into the canal sides, presumably used to isolate sections of the canal for drainage and repair. Also, at each bridge there is a crane ready to slide wooden boards across the canal for the same purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n61/P1270012.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;An old disused lock-type wooden gate nestles under the edge of the canal under a set of steel barriers which replace it. These can be craned into the slots either side of the canal to isolate a section of the canal. &quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most exciting section of the Bridgewater Canal is the Barton Swing Aquaduct which has carried it over the Manchester Ship Canal since 1894. It swivels in the middle to allow ships to pass below. How amazing is that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our travels took us to Dunham Massey Hall, a National Trust property adjacent to the canal. How exciting! We love to explore historic houses!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sadly it was closed on the day of our visit. Typical. However, as it was a lovely day and we were so close, we decided to go and be nosey anyway. To our delight we discovered more than enough to keep us interested. There was the old watermill, the stables, the deer park and even ice-cream!&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Some of the stables were later converted to garages. This was the estate's car wash!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The pie-chart is a clock-face, showing us the green cheese of opportunity for boats to enter the tunnel from this end. We'll just wait then, have our tea or something....&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n61/P1270079.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Liberty Belle freed to navigate the tunnel.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;We're in!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On our journey to Chester we were due to pass by the Anderton Boat Lift. This wonderful machine carries boats vertically between the canal and the River Weaver, 50 feet below. The alternative would have been a series of locks but the water loss involved when emptying the locks from the canal down to the river would not have been sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had no reason to be on the river but we couldn't resist a ride! Tony booked us a trip down and then back up again in the same morning.
We were sooo lucky with the weather. The whole process took ages and I wouldn't recommend it as part of a commute to work but as a ride it was wonderful!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n61/P1270204.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The huge cast iron boat lift protrudes from the canal. The duct connecting it to the canal disappears towards the canal.&quot; /&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We finally arrived in Chester. Despite the rain, the town still looked promising, so we decided to stay for a couple of days in the hope that the weather would change and we would have the chance to explore....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Chester! 
(It's a water tower...)&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Where Next?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am sorry that my newsletters are taking soooo long to compile, not only have we been busy travelling, we have been having some network and data problems on the way. Excuses, excuses!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are now on our way South, heading for Birmingham and planning to pop back to the house on or around the 24th October to get a few jobs done and collect some warmer clothes...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond that, we hope to spend the winter around the Milton Keynes area. More details will follow when we have worked them out...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If anyone is interested, the juddering we are experiencing is due to a bent propeller blade. Liberty Belle will need to be lifted out of the water for that to be fixed, so it will be a winter job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;3rd - 11th September 2019&lt;/h2&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n60/P1260656.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Liberty Belle cruising under the rainbow!&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Lancashire's changeable weather.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Between us and Liverpool lay Burnley and Wigan, where we had been warned to expect trouble. So we set off early on another grey and windy Lancashire morning, hoping to get through the first of these obstacles before anyone noticed us, and maybe get some shopping on the way...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n60/P1260603.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Liberty Belle, on a cloudy day, about to cross a small stone aquaduct with a plank crane used to dam the canal with planks if maintenance is required.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n60/P1260591cropped.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Ramps are built ito the canal edges every few miles to enable any horse which falls into the canal to get out again. The ducks now use these ramps.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Horse escape ramp making life easier for ducks.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get our supplies we hoped to pop into Morrisons which, according to Google Maps, was near to the canal and was due to open at 8 am.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We turned a corner and approached the bridge that we planned to moor next to for our shopping trip, steering to the right, towards the towpath.
Just as we did so, the supermarket came into view and we saw that it had its own mooring, but on the opposite side of the canal. As Tony quickly corrected the steering, another boat appeared from under the bridge heading towards us. Tony quickly jerked Liberty Belle over to the right again in order to allow the other boat to pass us on the correct side. All very tricky in the wind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poor Liberty Belle didn't know whether she was coming or going and we consequently got stuck aground. The helmsman on the other boat asked if we needed assistance as he passed by but we declined with thanks...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After getting properly afloat again we needed to reverse, in the wind, back around the corner and try to persuade Liberty Belle's bow to head for the supermarket mooring. After some fancy tiller work and a lot of luck, we tied up outside Morrisons only to be confronted by a locked gate....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;thoughtbubble&quot;&gt;I checked the supermarket opening times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;thoughtbubble&quot;&gt;Yep, it should be open.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;thoughtbubble&quot;&gt;As the gate was at the back of the supermarket, maybe they had forgotten to open it...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;thoughtbubble&quot;&gt;Maybe they never open it...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;thoughtbubble&quot;&gt;I found their phone number and began to ring them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;thoughtbubble&quot;&gt;No answer yet...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;thoughtbubble&quot;&gt;I suddenly had a thought. Maybe the gate can be opened with a boater's Waterways Facilities key or anti-vandal key, (usually used for locks and swing bridges).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I cut the phone call and we tried, with success!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having got through the gate and re-locked it, (the anti-vandal locks can be a fiddle at the best of times) we realised we didn't have a trolley token or a pound coin on us. We couldn't be bothered to fight our way back through the gate again and so limited ourselves to a basket-full of shopping - one very heavy basket! It was enough though and we set off again as soon as we could.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The Heron is our constant companion.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The famous Burnley Straight Mile, a huge embankment built to carry the Leeds &amp;amp; Liverpool canal above Burnley, is thought to be one of the Seven Wonders of the British canal system. It was built to avoid a series of locks which would slow the canal traffic down. At the time it was an innovative solution to cutting down the travel time for the cargo boats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tony agrees that it is a wonder - a wonder we got across it... The water here is so shallow and full of weed and rubbish, we felt we were chewing our way along.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The propeller began to complain so we stopped and Tony cleared a pile of rubbish from around it before setting off again. Shortly afterwards the propeller again complained, this time there was a large sack, amongst other things, wrapped around the workings. Once that was cleared we tried again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n60/DSCN2832cropped.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A large toy car for a child floating in the weedy canal as we look back to a tunnel.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;What is left of a remote control car,&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Burnley's famous straight mile&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We did, in fact, stop in Burnley, but only for a brief look around. They have an interesting little museum in an old toll house, explaining the town's links with the textile industry and the canal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the men working in the museum explained that Burnley did have a bad reputation amongst boaters but things were improving. Apparently, when Burnley has a festival in the town and lots of boaters want to moor there, he sleeps in the old toll house to keep an eye on the boats! In fact, he had seen someone staring into our boat and had investigated for us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, thanks very much, enough said, off we go!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Tony working hard in the museum's schoolroom.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond this section, all the way to Liverpool, we kept finding other parts of the canal in the same condition. It was frustratingly slow progress. It didn't help that we were doing these double locks on our own and it kept on raining.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suddenly the engine cut out. Tony removed more rubbish from the propeller but this time something appeared to have been damaged.  Poor Liberty Belle now shudders and bumps as we are going along, as if we are driving over cobbles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually we arrived at a pound between two very close locks, where there were some boaters' facilities. In my wisdom (?) I decided to allow the next lock to fill up whilst we stopped to fill our water tank. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I nipped over and lifted one of the paddles to let the water drain in before coming back to help Tony manipulate the boat so that we could reach the very awkwardly positioned tap. It became apparent that one of our problems was Liberty Belle was getting grounded. The water in the pound seemed to be very low ... and getting lower...!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh no! Liberty Belle was grounded on one side and tipping...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I dashed back to the lock which was still trying to fill and failing because the water was passing straight through to the other side. The previous users had left a paddle open at the other end... we were rapidly emptying the pound! I dropped all the paddles and Tony dashed back to the previous lock to let water through that one too, down into the pound.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Liberty Belle gradually re-floated, so we stopped the flow of water from the lock above and all was well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All this happened outside the Canal &amp;amp; River Trust office window....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the panic was over and the rain had stopped, one of the volunteers emerged and helped us through the second lock...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n60/DSCN2837.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Some soil covered, derelict, stone domes beside the canal.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Some brick built mounds by the side of the canal.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Old kilns, maybe?&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n60/P1260672.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A blue Canal and River Trust work boat with a small pile of canal debris at the back.&quot; /&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;One of their boats with little heaps of rubbish removed from the propeller, similar to ours.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Liberty Belle continued to judder along noisily over the next couple of days  We stopped off in -&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;thoughtbubble&quot;&gt;Cherry Tree (nothing here);&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;thoughtbubble&quot;&gt;Withneld Fold (a pretty and interesting little village built around a paper mill);&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;thoughtbubble&quot;&gt;Chorley (not a single Chorley cake in sight);&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;thoughtbubble&quot;&gt;Red Rock Bridge (where a fellow boater assured us that his dogs were dangerous but wouldn't be able to reach us if we stayed off the pontoon near his boat).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n60/P1260685.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Two bridges, one over the canal, the other over a river.&quot; /&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n60/DSCN2857cropped.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Liberty Belle moored behind what appears to be a huge Anaconda like snake. In fact, probably a floating device which can be placed across the canal to contain some floating objcts.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Liberty Belle and a water snake!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The mill workers' cottages have the remains of the 'night soil' collection doors at the base of the back walls.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The other small door, higher up, is probably for other household waste collections.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a night at Red Rock Bridge we set off early; too early to say good bye to next door's dogs... We had Wigan and its 25 locks to face, which would be open for boaters at 8:30 having been padlocked overnight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We arrived to find two boats already queuing to go down the locks together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We loitered, waiting for them to go before we slipped into position against the tow path, then I helped the two boats through the first lock. We were pleasantly surprised at the prettiness of the canal here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lock keeper popped over to another moored boat to ascertain whether they intended to go down the locks too. They were, so he paired us up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lock keeper had a young man with him who seemed to know everyone. The woman I was locking with explained that he had been hanging around the locks for quite some time, helping the lock keepers. They had warmed to him and had managed to secure a Canal &amp;amp; River Trust apprenticeship for him. What a nice story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It transpired that our locking companions had been living on their boat for 6 years. Her brother had been living in their house during this time but was now moving out. They couldn't afford to run both a house and a boat so didn't feel they had any option but to sell their boat and move back into the house. She wasn't sure how she was going to cope, living in a home that didn't move about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our locking partners stopped in Wigan after much discussion with the lock keeper on where to moor, but we needed to carry on...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Gangway! We need to get to Wigan locks quickly!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n60/P1260704.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;An elegant, gently arched stone bridge carries the towpath over the entrance to a basin.&quot; /&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Lock numbers have changed over the years.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we arrived at the next lock we found a single-handed boater already leaving it. He was happy to wait for us to join him at the following lock, so we were soon partnered again. Single-handed boaters have to work very hard indeed to get through locks, so it is well worth their while to wait quite a long time for another boat to join them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were exhausted by the time we found our mooring at the other side of Wigan, outside a pub in a little village called Crooke. We deserved a pint! It turned out that we were moored in someone's private space but the landlady said they were away, so we were welcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n60/DSCN2860.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Liberty Belle facing the open lock gates with a second boat alongside.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Sharing the locks.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n60/DSCN2863.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Rachel sat on a lock gate waiting for the lock to empty.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Waiting patiently in the sunshine.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Crooke the canal was surprisingly pretty with some views and occasional sunshine (our first in Lancashire). We thought we might stop in Par-boiled (Parbold) which looked delightful with its canal side cafe &amp;amp; old windmill gallery. Unfortunately there was a fishing competition taking place along the tow path, occupying all of the visitor moorings, so we had to keep travelling to Burscough Bridge where we moored for a couple of nights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(We now plan to stop at Par-boiled on our way back with Mary on board.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n60/P1260721.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Liberty Belle moored waiting for the lock to be ready beside a wooden bench, underneath a tall steel motorway bridge.&quot; /&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We finally found Chorley Cakes in a supermarket in Burscough Bridge. Yay!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Old Wharf area here has been nicely restored and has pleasant looking cafes and restaurants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a rainy day in Burscough we woke up the next morning to sunshine and set off for Maghull, as close to Liverpool as we dared to go before nightfall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had moorings booked in the city on Weds 11th and were allowed to arrive sometime between 1 and 4 pm.
Between Maghull and Liverpool is a swing bridge which can only be operated outside rush hour (9:30am until 2 pm, then 6:30 pm until 7:30 am) to cause minimum disruption to road traffic. In order to time our arrival in Liverpool correctly we needed to leave our mooring in Maghull at 
8 am, go through the swing bridge at 9:30 and slide into Liverpool sometime in the afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All went well and we arrived at the swing bridge 5 minutes before we could operate it. Then, despite the shallowness of the canal reducing our speed so much that we thought we would never get there, we reached the top of the Liverpool Dock locks just as they were being opened. Unfortunately two boats were ahead of us so we had to wait, but not for long as there were 3 lock keepers in attendance, helping us all through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The locks were padlocked again behind us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once at the entrance to the docks our route through to our mooring was complicated, weaving from dock to dock through various narrow gaps! We had a map, verbal instructions and a lock keeper meeting us at the last lock... Luckily it all went well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was exciting getting glimpses of the Liver Birds and then suddenly arriving right outside the building! After several bridges and tunnels, one of them under the new museum, we finally passed through Albert Dock into Salthouse Dock where we managed to moor in our allocated space, despite the wind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could hardly believe we were finally here!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Where Next?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This newsletter has been a long time coming!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are now on our way to Wales on the LLangollen Canal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We expect to come back via Nantwich (LIberty Belle's 'home town'), then through Wolverhampton and Birmingham to Leamington Spa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From there we plan to get a train back to the house to get a few jobs done.

&lt;h2&gt;28th August - 2nd September 2019&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/maps/n59map.png&quot; alt=&quot;Our route&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Our route&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n59/P1260486.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A stone bridge with the top stones laid in and upside down 'V' rather than a curved top.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The bridges here are slightly pointy at the top and have a handy white mark to indicate the centre of the canal.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the lovely Bank Holiday weekend we woke up to rain so we delayed our departure whilst we visited the launderette.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had thought we would be able to 'nip' up to Lancaster before collecting Mary in Liverpool, but because the route passes through the tidal section of the Ribble, there are specific windows of opportunity when the tide is right and the locks are manned. Unfortunately we would either have to rush and see very little or take too long and delay the rest of our plans, so we will have to come back and complete that section another time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, off towards Liverpool! The canal began to wind around, following the contours of the land and making steering in the wind quite tricky... We would have had some beautiful views if it were not for the high hedges alongside the canal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n59/DSCN2774.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A lock gate at which the ground paddles are raised by lifting a wooden beam attached directly to the paddle by a vertical post.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Yet another type of ground paddle mechanism!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Many of them were broken beyond use and others were very tricky to move.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n59/P1260443.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Rachel demonstrating how to lift the paddle.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Heeeave....!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n59/P1260476.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A stone bridge with a second arch above the one spanning the canal.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;An unusually shaped bridge&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n59/P1260496.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Stone walls with two gates leading to the embankment slope.5&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Some walled areas, on a steep slope with gated fronts.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Any ideas?&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suddenly we had views across the countryside as we ascended the pretty Greenberfield Locks to the highest point on the Leeds &amp;amp; Liverpool Canal. After these the locks would be taking us downhill to Liverpool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The facilities at Greenberfield were excellent, including hot showers, a refreshments booth (calling itself a cafe) and a friendly lock keeper who recommended some moorings at Barnoldswick. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it was raining we decided to have our cup of tea on the boat rather than outside the cafe booth but I went to see if I could buy some cake from the lady serving. I explained the situation and she sold me two slices of banana, sultana and walnut cake to take away. During our chat she asked me where we were going and she advised me not to stop in Burnley on our way to Liverpool as it has a bad reputation amongst boaters... Oh heck, that was one of the places we had hoped to moor overnight later in the week. I thanked her for the advice and we altered our future plans accordingly...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst in the room housing the Elsan point facility, Tony discovered a swallow's nest. We took it in turns to stand there and watch the mother bird coming and going through the open window. We wondered if she will have time to rear her baby before it's time to fly off for the winter...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n59/P1260543.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A gaping mouthed chick with its head raised above the level of the feather lined nest.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;A baby swallow above the elsan point.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;I wonder what a swallow's sense of smell is like...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n59/P1260552.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A Canak and River Trust sign reading 'Caution: Ducks at Play. Please be sensitive: don't mention plum sauce or l'orange. '&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;You have to hand it to them, the Canal &amp;amp; River Trust do try to amuse us!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n59/P1260535.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A square red-brick lock keepers cottage with eater rushing underneath.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Water from a reservoir in the Dales to top up the L &amp;amp; L Canal at its high point passes underneath the lock keepers cottage.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually we left the swallows in peace and found the excellent moorings at Barnoldswick. We were pleased to discover that it was a proper little market town which had grown due to the arrival of the canal which had facilitated the building of textile mills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bancroft Mill, dating from 1914, was the last one built and continued until 1978. The engine house has been preserved as a museum by volunteers who regularly run the engine. Tony and I went to visit and, despite it not being a steam day and all the volunteers being in a meeting and so unavailable, we found the museum to be fascinating. The displays of old photographs and artefacts along with the explanatory notes were expertly done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n59/DSCN2787.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Rachel in the mill beside a large steam engine.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Bancroft Mill has fascinating displays of old photographs.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n59/DSCN2800.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A sign at the mill reading 'Are You Enjoying Your Visit?: Why not become a fill member. For only £12 a year you can visit us as many times as you wish. Plus our newsletter and as a volunteer your personal oily rag and tea stained mug.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Bancroft Mill! You know how to tempt people!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all that history we treated ourselves to a drink in The Barlick Tap, housed in the original village Co-Op. (Barlick has been a local alternative name for Barnoldswick for hundreds of years apparently.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The barman's mother was the daughter of a butcher and knew how to make the best sausage rolls which were being offered at the bar for a donation in the charity collecting pot... Jackpot!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We decided to stay here an extra day so that we could walk in the hills surrounding the town and, of course, re-visit The Barlick Tap...!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n59/DSCN2802.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Rachel anout to enter the micro pub.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;It would be rude not to...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n59/DSCN2801.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A footpath sign with witches on broomsticks.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Part of our circular walk was on The Pendle Witch Way.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;We loved their signs!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n59/DSCN2803.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A carved stne sign with some letters carved backwards.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;A strange stone sign just outside Barlick.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before setting off the next morning, we went for a brief walk to try and find the remains of an old canal arm near our mooring. The arm was only 1/2 mile long and went through two tunnels to a quarry where the stone was loaded directly onto barges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The quarry has been filled in and presumably used as a landfill site because there are several vents emerging from the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The canal arm is derelict and overgrown but sections of it can still be seen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n59/DSCN2810.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Rachel part way down the wooded slope to the old canal.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Part way down the steps to the end of the derelict canal arm.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;One of the air vents in the ground where the quarry used to be.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, off we went. It seemed that Leeds and Liverpool Canal weaves around the Lancashire border because we came across several 'Welcome to Lancashire' signs over the next few days. Strangely we are not usually informed of our exit from any county. There was one exception to this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n59/P1260561.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A sign reading 'County Border: Lancashire | Yorkshire'&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;A more informative sign than usual.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt; 
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n59/P1260567.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A Canal and River Trust sign reading 'Danger! Happiness levels may rise to explosive levels.'&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;A Canal &amp;amp; River Trust morale booster.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our route now took us through Foulridge Tunnel. It is a mile long and is only wide enough to take one boat at a time. The entry is controlled by traffic lights with only a 10 minute window each hour in which to start your journey through. The lights were against us when we arrived but after stopping at the facilities in front of the tunnel to fill up on water, we just had time to start the engine, untie and move to the waiting area when the lights were suddenly in our favour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n59/P1260572.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Liberty Belle approaching the entrance to the Foulridge tunnel with two green traffic lights.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;We have a green light!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n59/P1260580.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Looking back the traffic lights make a 'sad face' shape.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Foulridge Tunnel is sad to see us go...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soon after the tunnel we arrived at our safe mooring in Barrowford, just a couple of miles from the dreaded Burnley....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With our usual assumption that troublesome people are not early risers, we set our alarm clock for an early start, hoping to get through unhindered!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Where Next?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still on course for Liverpool on 11th September. The plans to go to Chester, Ellesmere Port and then Stone look more and more ambitious as we look into the detail... We still hope to get back to the house some time in October.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rachel Glombek</name></author><category term="LibertyBelle" /><summary type="html">From Skipton to Barnoldswick 28th August - 2nd September 2019</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Bank Holiday Weekends are for Drinking, not Eating.</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/libertybellenewsletter/libertybelle/2019/09/06/bank-holiday-weekends-are-for-drinking-not-eating.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Bank Holiday Weekends are for Drinking, not Eating." /><published>2019-09-06T20:57:00+01:00</published><updated>2019-09-06T20:57:00+01:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/libertybellenewsletter/libertybelle/2019/09/06/bank-holiday-weekends-are-for-drinking-not-eating</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/libertybellenewsletter/libertybelle/2019/09/06/bank-holiday-weekends-are-for-drinking-not-eating.html">&lt;h2&gt;From Leeds to Skipton&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;21st - 27th August 2019&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/maps/n58map.png&quot; alt=&quot;Our route&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Our route&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n58/P1260421.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Liberty Belle cruising the canal with blue sky and hills in the background.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Bank Holiday sunshine and views. &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After restocking the boat stores we left Leeds behind, with a promise from Cathy that she would join us for the Bank Holiday weekend at a little place called Saltaire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a brief section on the RIver Aire, we were back onto a proper canal, surely this should be easy. Our first surprise was the strange mechanisms for opening the locks. There is always something new!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n58/P1260280.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Liberty Belle about to pass under the blue cast iron Leeds Bridge.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Heading for the Leeds Bridge on the River Aire.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Notice the clock on the left...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n58/P1260283.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The clock tower showing two faces with different times.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Before the bridge it was 2:47.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;On the other side it was 12:00.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Magic!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n58/P1260284.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The Leeds coat of arms on Leeds Bridge.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The Leeds Coat of Arms has 3 Owls from the family crest of the city's first Alderman.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Apparently he liked owls - who doesn't?&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n58/P1260269.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A painted mural of a flying heron beside the river.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;An eye-catching mural on the side of the canal.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n58/P1260289.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Rachel winding the paddles up using a horizontal bar attached to the hidden mechanism.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Ok, this is new.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Clockwise to lift??&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Good guess!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n58/P1260290.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A lock gate with a horizontal rack and pinion mechanism attached to a rocking wooden paddle arm.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;A different style of gate paddle too.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;At least I can see the mechanism and how it works.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We travelled along, watching the dragonflies darting and dancing around Liberty Belle, even investigating indoors, briefly. The swallows spent their days swooping overhead and the evenings darting around close to the canal water. The towpaths are beautifully kept and wide enough for walkers, runners and cyclists to co-exist. Consequently they are well used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n58/P1260302.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Approaching a multiple stone arched railway viaduct only partially visible.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;This stone viaduct would be quite impressive if we could see it all...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n58/P1260304.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Many more arches are visible behind a fence.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Just a glimpse over the fence...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Looks like a milestone...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Maybe it marks 1/2 mile to the next lock...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n58/P1260361.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Passing under a black and white painted cast iron bridge with a church tower behind.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Arriving at Saltaire in the sunshine.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a beautiful day when we finally arrived at Saltaire. The village is named after the man who created it, Titus Salt, and the River Aire which runs though it. Titus Salt made his money in the textile industry in Bradford where he owned several mills. Disgusted by the conditions in which his employees lived, he built a new mill on a plot between the railway and canal on the banks of the River Aire which replaced his Bradford Mills. At the same time he built an entire village for his workers; houses, shops, church, school, hospital, almshouses, reading rooms, bath houses, entertainment hall and a recreation park. The mill is now used as a retail centre, an art gallery, business space and housing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The whole village has been very well kept and is delightful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we collected Cathy from the railway station and had a brief visit from Garry and Helen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After lunch we all went for a stroll and an ice-cream for pudding. Tony and I, in our wisdom, decided to have the 'special' - black vanilla. The ice-cream was indeed black. It stained our mouths and the front of my dress! Taste-wise it was vaguely vanilla flavoured and really not worth the bother...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n58/DSCN2664.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The huge stone mill built by Titus Salt with its accompanying tall square chimney.&quot; /&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Black vanilla ice-cream.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Cathy as extra crew, we set off and enjoyed a weekend of fabulous weather and beautiful views.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Sometimes it takes two.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Sunday we decided to treat ourselves to a pub roast dinner. At the appropriate time of day, we moored up and investigated the local pubs. None of them were serving food at all over the Bank Holiday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What? Really?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;'Fraid so...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A friendly couple on the towpath had recommended a pub just a few miles further along the canal so we set off in Liberty Belle to find it, hoping we would get there before they stopped serving...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, we did find it but their kitchen was closed too. What is it with these people? Instead we had a pint and some crisps in the pub, an organ recital in the local church and a cream tea in the village hall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After these delights we set off again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n58/P1260414.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Cathy at the bow of Liberty Belle.&quot; /&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We found a mooring in Skipton and went in search of some dinner - we felt we deserved something special after the Sunday Lunch nonsense!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After much discussion we settled for the Skipton Balti House. It was definitely the correct decision. After much pondering over the menu we had the most delicious meal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We spent the following day exploring the delights of the lovely Skipton before saying goodbye to Cathy, who had to catch her train back home. We all agreed that it was a town worth visiting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Where Next?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are due to arrive in Liverpool on 11th September, leaving on the 15th with Mary as extra crew! We plan to visit Chester, Ellesmere Port and Stone during her visit. We have a vague plan of visiting the house sometime in October.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rachel Glombek</name></author><category term="LibertyBelle" /><summary type="html">From Leeds to Skipton 21st - 27th August 2019</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Risking the Red Zone</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/libertybellenewsletter/libertybelle/2019/08/29/risking-the-red-zone.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Risking the Red Zone" /><published>2019-08-29T19:32:00+01:00</published><updated>2019-08-29T19:32:00+01:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/libertybellenewsletter/libertybelle/2019/08/29/risking-the-red-zone</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/libertybellenewsletter/libertybelle/2019/08/29/risking-the-red-zone.html">&lt;h2&gt;From Brighouse to Leeds&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;12th - 20th August 2019&lt;/h2&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Leeds Dock.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst travelling along, we had been given notification by the Canal &amp;amp; River Trust that two flood locks ahead of us were closed due to the river water being dangerously high. We decided to stay in Brighouse whilst we waited for the water level to go down. We had a relaxing day, running a few errands and then having a delicious meal at Garry and Helen's cooked for us by the lovely Molly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following morning we were able to move off again, the flood locks having been re-opened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initially we continued with our 'short lock technique' but the locks were getting longer and soon we no longer needed to take special measures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The weather was kind to us and we enjoyed being back in the land of the kingfisher and heron.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n57/P1260144.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Looking back to the canal lock on the left and the river to the right.&quot; /&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;We haven't travelled along the Huddersfield Canal yet...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n57/P1260161.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Liberty Belle passing under a bridge looking out for the turning onto the canal hidden in the river bank.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;On the river looking for the flood lock onto the canal. Somewhere on the right...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n57/P1260165.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The open flood lock to the canal.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;...Here it is!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;It's a good job it is open as there appears to be nowhere to pull over...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout Yorkshire we have been surrounded by Himalayan Balsam creating a hazey pink border to the canal. Pretty though they are, they have taken over from the variety of plants which might otherwise have been there.
Similarly, In the hills around us, the native heather is often fighting against rhododendron bushes. They too can look lovely but are crowding out the natural species of plants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To remind us that summer is coming to a close we had blackberries and bales of hay in the fields around us and the Black Headed Gulls have lost their signature summer plumage. Despite these signs, we still came across the occasional cygnet, duckling and young moorhen. We even saw a pair of moorhens building a nest!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Children of course are still on holiday and we came across groups of boys jumping into the canal from the locks. Not something we or the lock keepers were keen on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n57/P1260189.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A piar of swans and a relatively young cygnet.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;A late brood.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually we reached a lock opening out onto a stretch of river. The river level indicator was just touching the red zone, suggesting that the conditions were again becoming dangerous. We stopped for lunch and watched two other boats pass through the lock.
We discussed the situation...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stretch of river was only a mile long, we would be travelling with the river flow, it was only just in the red....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We checked the Canal &amp;amp; River Trust's website and there were no warnings about the flood lock (yet), so we took the chance and went for it..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We travelled along a little faster than usual due to the flow of the river, and kept a sharp eye open for trouble.
We could see the flood lock gates in the distance and they were shut.  The approach to the lock was tricky, with a weir immediately on the right and apparently no landing stage on the left until it was revealed at the last minute behind the weeds. It was obviously too short for us. Tony steered for it anyway, fighting with the weir which wanted to drag Liberty Belle towards it. He managed to force Liberty Belle's bow in the corner where the lock gate and landing stage met. I clambered off from the bow, taking the rope with me. After a struggle, Tony managed to straighten Liberty Belle up and I grabbed the middle rope, pulling her in. Tony had to walk along the gunwales from the stern to get off and tie her in place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lock gates were difficult and Tony had to give me a hand but, finally, we got off the river and into the lock. Shortly afterwards we were out on the other side, into the safety of the calm waters of the canal at Mirfield.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;River level in the Red Zone.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lock was closed to traffic by the following morning. With that experience behind us and more rain forecast, we decided to get as many of the river stretches behind us as we could before the river levels rose any more. This meant missing out a short canal arm to Dewsbury, which was a shame.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All went well until we reached a place called Horbury where the river level indicator was well into the red, so we moored up near a pub, prepared to wait as many days as it took for the level to go down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n57/P1260173.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A string of large orange buoys protecting boats on the canal from the nearby weir.&quot; /&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The same bridge, from the other side, looking towards Liberty Belle.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it turned out, we were able to move off the following day, the river level now being in the green! So we set off for Wakefield, a place I must admit I had not heard of but turned out to be a very pleasant surprise. We stayed for a couple of nights to give us a chance to look around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wakefield's Cathedral was particularly friendly and welcoming. We visited the cafe there for tea &amp;amp; cake and liked it so much we went back for lunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Wakefield museum was made especially interesting with its displays about the Victorian Eco-warrier, explorer, taxidermist and eccentric Charles Waterton.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After making the most of the lovely Wakefield, we set off early the next morning. In front of us was a long stretch of river that we had no intention of dawdling on in case the levels rose again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The river was wide and fed into a wide stretch of canal. The locks were massive and electrically controlled, so my job was easy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n57/P1260216.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The canal split in two and passing over two aqueducts.&quot; /&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Liberty Belle dwarfed by the lock.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;It makes a change from trying to fit in diagonally!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We arrived in Leeds and were lucky to find a 48 hour mooring in Leeds Dock within easy reach of the city centre. We got ourselves a map and some advice from the lovely lady in the tourist information office and off we went.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is beautiful architecture in abundance in Leeds. I started off photographing each interesting and lovely building but I eventually gave up and just looked. The Victorian and Edwardian shopping arcades are simply amazing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The museum somehow didn't quite grab us and we tip-toed around the Catholic Cathedral.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;It is made of rusty metal bars, bent in such a way as to create triangular shadows which appear to move as you approach it.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Lovely.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;It looks really spooky!&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Every item was rather more than a penny when we visited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During our last evening in Leeds we were relaxing when we heard a strange thumping noise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Was it our water pump? No.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe it was a machine banging in posts...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It sounded like the dinosaur in Jurassic Park, gradually getting nearer and nearer...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually, we saw the cause. Drummers were leading an Indian wedding party to a restaurant opposite our moorings in Leeds Dock. There must have been three or four generations there, all dressed up and in dancing mood! The excitement and joy was infectious. As they enjoyed their party, we had an early night ready for the next day's cruising.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Where Next?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Leeds we will be turning the corner and heading West along the Leeds and Liverpool Canal over the Pennines. We are looking forward to the views and exploring more of Yorkshire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hope to arrive in Liverpool during the second week of September.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rachel Glombek</name></author><category term="LibertyBelle" /><summary type="html">From Brighouse to Leeds 12th - 20th August 2019</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Special Anniversary Edition</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/libertybellenewsletter/libertybelle/2019/08/23/special-anniversary-edition.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Special Anniversary Edition" /><published>2019-08-23T21:25:00+01:00</published><updated>2019-08-23T21:25:00+01:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/libertybellenewsletter/libertybelle/2019/08/23/special-anniversary-edition</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/libertybellenewsletter/libertybelle/2019/08/23/special-anniversary-edition.html">&lt;h2&gt;Special Anniversary Edition&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;23rd August 2018 - 23rd August 2019&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n56/DSCN2681.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Tony and Rachel on Liberty Belle a Saltaire&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;A year on&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wow! It was a whole year ago that we bought Liberty Belle and began our journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;We have travelled along 1163 miles of canal, through 1245 locks.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;We have discovered several ways to sink a canal boat and attempted two of them.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Liberty Belle has gained a few dents and lost some paint along the way.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;We have passed the time of day with lots of people and seen countless boats (mostly moored), some of them more than once!&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;We have visited hamlets, villages, towns &amp;amp; cities, museums, churches, minsters &amp;amp; cathedrals.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;We have weathered all kinds of weather including too hot, too cold, too wet and too windy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What an adventure!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Things we have learnt&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A plan rarely comes together&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;You should never pass a tap without topping up with water&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Steering in reverse is mostly a matter of luck&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Even if you think you don't need fenders at a mooring, you need fenders.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The BBC Weather App talks nonsense&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;There are a few narrow boats called Liberty Belle but most are called Carpe Diem, Narrow Escape or Meander&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;There are no Waitrose shops in the North&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;It's not what a museum has but how it presents it that is important.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Wet coal doesn't burn hot.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Coal is always wet because it is packed in special plastic bags that allow rain in but not out again.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;There is no time to learn a new language or read a book or practice the ukulele or do a crossword or embroider.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;It is possible for a couple to live on a narrow boat for a whole year and remain married...&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Just because there is a mooring space/toilet/elsan point/tap marked on the map, it isn't necessarily there.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Ducks are good mothers and geese are just shit machines&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Despite there being 34,000 canal boats registered there are hardly any actually moving on the canals. We can travel for days without meeting any! (There was a brief flurry one day in June..)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Our fears are usually unfounded.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A day isn't long enough, nor is a year...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Visitors&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We love having visitors! Some pop by for a cuppa, some visit for the day and others stay and travel with us. We don't always remember to take photos of our visitors but here are some we did take...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also had some near misses from Craig (passing by on a train), Aub (a day or so out of sync), Chris and Jan (unknowingly nearby in their camper van)...plus others, I'm sure!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Future Plans&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, bearing in mind that our plans rarely come together...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We intend to travel through Yorkshire, to Liverpool, Lancaster, Cheshire and Wales before heading south for the winter. We still need to study the winter lock stoppages but we think Milton Keynes will be a good winter base. We still have a lot of miles to explore so we will need at least one more summer....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Watch this space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Our travels so far.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/maps/OneYearMap.png&quot; alt=&quot;Our route&quot; /&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Our route. We are up the top end now!&lt;/p&gt;
