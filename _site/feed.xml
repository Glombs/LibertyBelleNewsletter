&lt;h2&gt;3rd - 11th September 2019&lt;/h2&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Lancashire's changeable weather.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Between us and Liverpool lay Burnley and Wigan, where we had been warned to expect trouble. So we set off early on another grey and windy Lancashire morning, hoping to get through the first of these obstacles before anyone noticed us, and maybe get some shopping on the way...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n60/P1260603.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;2&quot; /&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get our supplies we hoped to pop into Morrisons which, according to Google Maps, was near to the canal and was due to open at 8 am.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We turned a corner and approached the bridge that we planned to moor next to for our shopping trip, steering to the right, towards the towpath.
Just as we did so, the supermarket came into view and we saw that it had its own mooring, but on the opposite side of the canal. As Tony quickly corrected the steering, another boat appeared from under the bridge heading towards us. Tony quickly jerked Liberty Belle over to the right again in order to allow the other boat to pass us on the correct side. All very tricky in the wind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poor Liberty Belle didn't know whether she was coming or going and we consequently got stuck aground. The helmsman on the other boat asked if we needed assistance as he passed by but we declined with thanks...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After getting properly afloat again we needed to reverse, in the wind, back around the corner and try to persuade Liberty Belle's bow to head for the supermarket mooring. After some fancy tiller work and a lot of luck, we tied up outside Morrisons only to be confronted by a locked gate....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I checked the supermarket opening times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yep, it should be open.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the gate was at the back of the supermarket, maybe they had forgotten to open it...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe they never open it...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found their phone number and began to ring them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No answer yet...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suddenly had a thought. Maybe the gate can be opened with a boater's Waterways Facilities key or anti-vandal key, (usually used for locks and swing bridges).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I cut the phone call and we tried, with success!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having got through the gate and re-locked it, (the anti-vandal locks can be a fiddle at the best of times) we realised we didn't have a trolley token or a pound coin on us. We couldn't be bothered to fight our way back through the gate again and so limited ourselves to a basket-full of shopping - one very heavy basket! It was enough though and we set off again as soon as we could.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Heron&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The famous Burnley Straight Mile, a huge embankment built to carry the Leeds &amp;amp; Liverpool canal above Burnley, is thought to be one of the Seven Wonders of the British canal system. It was built to avoid a series of locks which would slow the canal traffic down. At the time it was an innovative solution to cutting down the travel time for the cargo boats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tony agrees that it is a wonder - a wonder we got across it... The water here is so shallow and full of weed and rubbish, we felt we were chewing our way along.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The propeller began to complain so we stopped and Tony cleared a pile of rubbish from around it before setting off again. Shortly afterwards the propeller again complained, this time there was a large sack, amongst other things, wrapped around the workings. Once that was cleared we tried again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n60/DSCN2832cropped.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;5&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;What is left of a remote control car,&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;remotely controlled straight into the canal.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Burnley's famous straight mile&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We did, in fact, stop in Burnley, but only for a brief look around. They have an interesting little museum in an old toll house, explaining the town's links with the textile industry and the canal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the men working in the museum explained that Burnley did have a bad reputation amongst boaters but things were improving. Apparently, when Burnley has a festival in the town and lots of boaters want to moor there, he sleeps in the old toll house to keep an eye on the boats! In fact, he had seen someone staring into our boat and had investigated for us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, thanks very much, enough said, off we go!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n60/P1260620.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;7&quot; /&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Tony working hard in the museum's schoolroom.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond this section, all the way to Liverpool, we kept finding other parts of the canal in the same condition. It was frustratingly slow progress. It didn't help that we were doing these double locks on our own and it kept on raining.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suddenly the engine cut out. Tony removed more rubbish from the propeller but this time something appeared to have been damaged.  Poor Liberty Belle now shudders and bumps as we are going along, as if we are driving over cobbles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n60/P1260629.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;9&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Flying over the motorway on the back of an aqua-duck.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually we arrived at a pound between two very close locks, where there were some boaters' facilities. In my wisdom (?) I decided to allow the next lock to fill up whilst we stopped to fill our water tank. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I nipped over and lifted one of the paddles to let the water drain in before coming back to help Tony manipulate the boat so that we could reach the very awkwardly positioned tap. It became apparent that one of our problems was Liberty Belle was getting grounded. The water in the pound seemed to be very low ... and getting lower...!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh no! Liberty Belle was grounded on one side and tipping...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I dashed back to the lock which was still trying to fill and failing because the water was passing straight through to the other side. The previous users had left a paddle open at the other end... we were rapidly emptying the pound! I dropped all the paddles and Tony dashed back to the previous lock to let water through that one too, down into the pound.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Liberty Belle gradually re-floated, so we stopped the flow of water from the lock above and all was well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All this happened outside the Canal &amp;amp; River Trust office window....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the panic was over and the rain had stopped, one of the volunteers emerged and helped us through the second lock...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Some brick built mounds by the side of the canal.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Old kilns, maybe?&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Liberty Belle continued to judder along noisily over the next couple of days  We stopped off in -&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cherry Tree (nothing here);&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Withneld Fold (a pretty and interesting little village built around a paper mill);&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chorley (not a single Chorley cake in sight);&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Red Rock Bridge (where a fellow boater assured us that his dogs were dangerous but wouldn't be able to reach us if we stayed off the pontoon near his boat).&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The other small door, higher up, is probably for other household waste collections.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a night at Red Rock Bridge we set off early; too early to say good bye to next door's dogs... We had Wigan and its 25 locks to face, which would be open for boaters at 8:30 having been padlocked overnight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We arrived to find two boats already queuing to go down the locks together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We loitered, waiting for them to go before we slipped into position against the tow path, then I helped the two boats through the first lock. We were pleasantly surprised at the prettiness of the canal here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lock keeper popped over to another moored boat to ascertain whether they intended to go down the locks too. They were, so he paired us up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lock keeper had a young man with him who seemed to know everyone. The woman I was locking with explained that he had been hanging around the locks for quite some time, helping the lock keepers. They had warmed to him and had managed to secure a Canal &amp;amp; River Trust apprenticeship for him. What a nice story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It transpired that our locking companions had been living on their boat for 6 years. Her brother had been living in their house during this time but was now moving out. They couldn't afford to run both a house and a boat so didn't feel they had any option but to sell their boat and move back into the house. She wasn't sure how she was going to cope, living in a home that didn't move about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our locking partners stopped in Wigan after much discussion with the lock keeper on where to moor, but we needed to carry on...&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Lock numbers have changed over the years.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we arrived at the next lock we found a single-handed boater already leaving it. He was happy to wait for us to join him at the following lock, so we were soon partnered again. Single-handed boaters have to work very hard indeed to get through locks, so it is well worth their while to wait quite a long time for another boat to join them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were exhausted by the time we found our mooring at the other side of Wigan, outside a pub in a little village called Crooke. We deserved a pint! It turned out that we were moored in someone's private space but the landlady said they were away, so we were welcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n60/DSCN2860.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;23&quot; /&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Waiting patiently in the sunshine.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Crooke the canal was surprisingly pretty with some views and occasional sunshine (our first in Lancashire). We thought we might stop in Par-boiled (Parbold) which looked delightful with its canal side cafe &amp;amp; old windmill gallery. Unfortunately there was a fishing competition taking place along the tow path, occupying all of the visitor moorings, so we had to keep travelling to Burscough Bridge where we moored for a couple of nights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(We now plan to stop at Par-boiled on our way back with Mary on board.)&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We finally found Chorley Cakes in a supermarket in Burscough Bridge. Yay!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Old Wharf area here has been nicely restored and has pleasant looking cafes and restaurants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a rainy day in Burscough we woke up the next morning to sunshine and set off for Maghull, as close to Liverpool as we dared to go before nightfall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had moorings booked in the city on Weds 11th and were allowed to arrive sometime between 1 and 4 pm.
Between Maghull and Liverpool is a swing bridge which can only be operated outside rush hour (9:30am until 2 pm, then 6:30 pm until 7:30 am) to cause minimum disruption to road traffic. In order to time our arrival in Liverpool correctly we needed to leave our mooring in Maghull at 
8 am, go through the swing bridge at 9:30 and slide into Liverpool sometime in the afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All went well and we arrived at the swing bridge 5 minutes before we could operate it. Then, despite the shallowness of the canal reducing our speed so much that we thought we would never get there, we reached the top of the Liverpool Dock locks just as they were being opened. Unfortunately two boats were ahead of us so we had to wait, but not for long as there were 3 lock keepers in attendance, helping us all through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The locks were padlocked again behind us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once at the entrance to the docks our route through to our mooring was complicated, weaving from dock to dock through various narrow gaps! We had a map, verbal instructions and a lock keeper meeting us at the last lock... Luckily it all went well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was exciting getting glimpses of the Liver Birds and then suddenly arriving right outside the building! After several bridges and tunnels, one of them under the new museum, we finally passed through Albert Dock into Salthouse Dock where we managed to moor in our allocated space, despite the wind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could hardly believe we were finally here!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Where Next?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This newsletter has been a long time coming!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are now on our way to Wales on the LLangollen Canal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We expect to come back via Nantwich (LIberty Belle's 'home town'), then through Wolverhampton and Birmingham to Leamington Spa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From there we plan to get a train back to the house to get a few jobs done.

&lt;h2&gt;28th August - 2nd September 2019&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/maps/n59map.png&quot; alt=&quot;Our route&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Our route&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n59/P1260486.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A stone bridge with the top stones laid in and upside down 'V' rather than a curved top.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The bridges here are slightly pointy at the top and have a handy white mark to indicate the centre of the canal.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the lovely Bank Holiday weekend we woke up to rain so we delayed our departure whilst we visited the launderette.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had thought we would be able to 'nip' up to Lancaster before collecting Mary in Liverpool, but because the route passes through the tidal section of the Ribble, there are specific windows of opportunity when the tide is right and the locks are manned. Unfortunately we would either have to rush and see very little or take too long and delay the rest of our plans, so we will have to come back and complete that section another time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, off towards Liverpool! The canal began to wind around, following the contours of the land and making steering in the wind quite tricky... We would have had some beautiful views if it were not for the high hedges alongside the canal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n59/DSCN2774.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A lock gate at which the ground paddles are raised by lifting a wooden beam attached directly to the paddle by a vertical post.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Yet another type of ground paddle mechanism!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Many of them were broken beyond use and others were very tricky to move.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n59/P1260443.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Rachel demonstrating how to lift the paddle.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Heeeave....!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n59/P1260476.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A stone bridge with a second arch above the one spanning the canal.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;An unusually shaped bridge&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n59/P1260496.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Stone walls with two gates leading to the embankment slope.5&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Some walled areas, on a steep slope with gated fronts.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Any ideas?&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suddenly we had views across the countryside as we ascended the pretty Greenberfield Locks to the highest point on the Leeds &amp;amp; Liverpool Canal. After these the locks would be taking us downhill to Liverpool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The facilities at Greenberfield were excellent, including hot showers, a refreshments booth (calling itself a cafe) and a friendly lock keeper who recommended some moorings at Barnoldswick. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it was raining we decided to have our cup of tea on the boat rather than outside the cafe booth but I went to see if I could buy some cake from the lady serving. I explained the situation and she sold me two slices of banana, sultana and walnut cake to take away. During our chat she asked me where we were going and she advised me not to stop in Burnley on our way to Liverpool as it has a bad reputation amongst boaters... Oh heck, that was one of the places we had hoped to moor overnight later in the week. I thanked her for the advice and we altered our future plans accordingly...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n59/P1260517.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A view of the canal looking back towards some low hills.&quot; /&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n59/P1260525.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A cast iron display sowing the lock in three differnt states and a boat being lifted upwards.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;A little cast iron model next to the canal, showing how a lock works.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst in the room housing the Elsan point facility, Tony discovered a swallow's nest. We took it in turns to stand there and watch the mother bird coming and going through the open window. We wondered if she will have time to rear her baby before it's time to fly off for the winter...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n59/P1260543.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A gaping mouthed chick with its head raised above the level of the feather lined nest.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;A baby swallow above the elsan point.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;I wonder what a swallow's sense of smell is like...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n59/P1260552.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A Canak and River Trust sign reading 'Caution: Ducks at Play. Please be sensitive: don't mention plum sauce or l'orange. '&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;You have to hand it to them, the Canal &amp;amp; River Trust do try to amuse us!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n59/P1260535.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A square red-brick lock keepers cottage with eater rushing underneath.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Water from a reservoir in the Dales to top up the L &amp;amp; L Canal at its high point passes underneath the lock keepers cottage.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually we left the swallows in peace and found the excellent moorings at Barnoldswick. We were pleased to discover that it was a proper little market town which had grown due to the arrival of the canal which had facilitated the building of textile mills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bancroft Mill, dating from 1914, was the last one built and continued until 1978. The engine house has been preserved as a museum by volunteers who regularly run the engine. Tony and I went to visit and, despite it not being a steam day and all the volunteers being in a meeting and so unavailable, we found the museum to be fascinating. The displays of old photographs and artefacts along with the explanatory notes were expertly done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n59/DSCN2787.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Rachel in the mill beside a large steam engine.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Bancroft Mill has fascinating displays of old photographs.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n59/DSCN2800.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A sign at the mill reading 'Are You Enjoying Your Visit?: Why not become a fill member. For only £12 a year you can visit us as many times as you wish. Plus our newsletter and as a volunteer your personal oily rag and tea stained mug.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Bancroft Mill! You know how to tempt people!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all that history we treated ourselves to a drink in The Barlick Tap, housed in the original village Co-Op. (Barlick has been a local alternative name for Barnoldswick for hundreds of years apparently.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The barman's mother was the daughter of a butcher and knew how to make the best sausage rolls which were being offered at the bar for a donation in the charity collecting pot... Jackpot!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We decided to stay here an extra day so that we could walk in the hills surrounding the town and, of course, re-visit The Barlick Tap...!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n59/DSCN2802.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Rachel anout to enter the micro pub.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;'Purveyor of Fine Ales'&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;It would be rude not to...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n59/DSCN2801.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A footpath sign with witches on broomsticks.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Part of our circular walk was on The Pendle Witch Way.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;We loved their signs!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n59/DSCN2803.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A carved stne sign with some letters carved backwards.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;A strange stone sign just outside Barlick.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before setting off the next morning, we went for a brief walk to try and find the remains of an old canal arm near our mooring. The arm was only 1/2 mile long and went through two tunnels to a quarry where the stone was loaded directly onto barges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The quarry has been filled in and presumably used as a landfill site because there are several vents emerging from the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The canal arm is derelict and overgrown but sections of it can still be seen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n59/DSCN2810.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Rachel part way down the wooded slope to the old canal.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Part way down the steps to the end of the derelict canal arm.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;One of the air vents in the ground where the quarry used to be.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, off we went. It seemed that Leeds and Liverpool Canal weaves around the Lancashire border because we came across several 'Welcome to Lancashire' signs over the next few days. Strangely we are not usually informed of our exit from any county. There was one exception to this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n59/P1260561.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A sign reading 'County Border: Lancashire | Yorkshire'&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;A more informative sign than usual.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt; 
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n59/P1260567.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A Canal and River Trust sign reading 'Danger! Happiness levels may rise to explosive levels.'&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;A Canal &amp;amp; River Trust morale booster.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our route now took us through Foulridge Tunnel. It is a mile long and is only wide enough to take one boat at a time. The entry is controlled by traffic lights with only a 10 minute window each hour in which to start your journey through. The lights were against us when we arrived but after stopping at the facilities in front of the tunnel to fill up on water, we just had time to start the engine, untie and move to the waiting area when the lights were suddenly in our favour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n59/P1260572.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Liberty Belle approaching the entrance to the Foulridge tunnel with two green traffic lights.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;We have a green light!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n59/P1260580.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Looking back the traffic lights make a 'sad face' shape.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Foulridge Tunnel is sad to see us go...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soon after the tunnel we arrived at our safe mooring in Barrowford, just a couple of miles from the dreaded Burnley....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With our usual assumption that troublesome people are not early risers, we set our alarm clock for an early start, hoping to get through unhindered!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Where Next?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still on course for Liverpool on 11th September. The plans to go to Chester, Ellesmere Port and then Stone look more and more ambitious as we look into the detail... We still hope to get back to the house some time in October.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rachel Glombek</name></author><category term="LibertyBelle" /><summary type="html">From Skipton to Barnoldswick 28th August - 2nd September 2019</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Bank Holiday Weekends are for Drinking, not Eating.</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/libertybellenewsletter/libertybelle/2019/09/06/bank-holiday-weekends-are-for-drinking-not-eating.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Bank Holiday Weekends are for Drinking, not Eating." /><published>2019-09-06T20:57:00+01:00</published><updated>2019-09-06T20:57:00+01:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/libertybellenewsletter/libertybelle/2019/09/06/bank-holiday-weekends-are-for-drinking-not-eating</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/libertybellenewsletter/libertybelle/2019/09/06/bank-holiday-weekends-are-for-drinking-not-eating.html">&lt;h2&gt;From Leeds to Skipton&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;21st - 27th August 2019&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/maps/n58map.png&quot; alt=&quot;Our route&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Our route&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n58/P1260421.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Liberty Belle cruising the canal with blue sky and hills in the background.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Bank Holiday sunshine and views. &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After restocking the boat stores we left Leeds behind, with a promise from Cathy that she would join us for the Bank Holiday weekend at a little place called Saltaire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a brief section on the RIver Aire, we were back onto a proper canal, surely this should be easy. Our first surprise was the strange mechanisms for opening the locks. There is always something new!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n58/P1260280.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Liberty Belle about to pass under the blue cast iron Leeds Bridge.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Heading for the Leeds Bridge on the River Aire.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Notice the clock on the left...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n58/P1260283.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The clock tower showing two faces with different times.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Before the bridge it was 2:47.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;On the other side it was 12:00.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Magic!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n58/P1260284.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The Leeds coat of arms on Leeds Bridge.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The Leeds Coat of Arms has 3 Owls from the family crest of the city's first Alderman.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Apparently he liked owls - who doesn't?&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n58/P1260269.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A painted mural of a flying heron beside the river.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;An eye-catching mural on the side of the canal.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n58/P1260289.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Rachel winding the paddles up using a horizontal bar attached to the hidden mechanism.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Ok, this is new.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Clockwise to lift??&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Good guess!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n58/P1260290.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A lock gate with a horizontal rack and pinion mechanism attached to a rocking wooden paddle arm.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;A different style of gate paddle too.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;At least I can see the mechanism and how it works.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We travelled along, watching the dragonflies darting and dancing around Liberty Belle, even investigating indoors, briefly. The swallows spent their days swooping overhead and the evenings darting around close to the canal water. The towpaths are beautifully kept and wide enough for walkers, runners and cyclists to co-exist. Consequently they are well used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n58/P1260302.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Approaching a multiple stone arched railway viaduct only partially visible.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;This stone viaduct would be quite impressive if we could see it all...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n58/P1260304.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Many more arches are visible behind a fence.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Just a glimpse over the fence...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n58/P1260320.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A single arched stone bridge over the canal with a small tower on one side.&quot; /&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n58/P1260300.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Many gantries of an electrified railway over a large steel bridge.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Not pretty but impressive.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n58/P1260316.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A boat constructed from odds and ends of wooden items.&quot; /&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Impressive, interesting.... odd!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Looks like a milestone...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Maybe it marks 1/2 mile to the next lock...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Arriving at Saltaire in the sunshine.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a beautiful day when we finally arrived at Saltaire. The village is named after the man who created it, Titus Salt, and the River Aire which runs though it. Titus Salt made his money in the textile industry in Bradford where he owned several mills. Disgusted by the conditions in which his employees lived, he built a new mill on a plot between the railway and canal on the banks of the River Aire which replaced his Bradford Mills. At the same time he built an entire village for his workers; houses, shops, church, school, hospital, almshouses, reading rooms, bath houses, entertainment hall and a recreation park. The mill is now used as a retail centre, an art gallery, business space and housing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The whole village has been very well kept and is delightful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we collected Cathy from the railway station and had a brief visit from Garry and Helen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After lunch we all went for a stroll and an ice-cream for pudding. Tony and I, in our wisdom, decided to have the 'special' - black vanilla. The ice-cream was indeed black. It stained our mouths and the front of my dress! Taste-wise it was vaguely vanilla flavoured and really not worth the bother...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Cathy as extra crew, we set off and enjoyed a weekend of fabulous weather and beautiful views.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Sometimes it takes two.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Sunday we decided to treat ourselves to a pub roast dinner. At the appropriate time of day, we moored up and investigated the local pubs. None of them were serving food at all over the Bank Holiday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What? Really?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;'Fraid so...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A friendly couple on the towpath had recommended a pub just a few miles further along the canal so we set off in Liberty Belle to find it, hoping we would get there before they stopped serving...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, we did find it but their kitchen was closed too. What is it with these people? Instead we had a pint and some crisps in the pub, an organ recital in the local church and a cream tea in the village hall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After these delights we set off again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We found a mooring in Skipton and went in search of some dinner - we felt we deserved something special after the Sunday Lunch nonsense!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After much discussion we settled for the Skipton Balti House. It was definitely the correct decision. After much pondering over the menu we had the most delicious meal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We spent the following day exploring the delights of the lovely Skipton before saying goodbye to Cathy, who had to catch her train back home. We all agreed that it was a town worth visiting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Where Next?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are due to arrive in Liverpool on 11th September, leaving on the 15th with Mary as extra crew! We plan to visit Chester, Ellesmere Port and Stone during her visit. We have a vague plan of visiting the house sometime in October.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rachel Glombek</name></author><category term="LibertyBelle" /><summary type="html">From Leeds to Skipton 21st - 27th August 2019</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Risking the Red Zone</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/libertybellenewsletter/libertybelle/2019/08/29/risking-the-red-zone.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Risking the Red Zone" /><published>2019-08-29T19:32:00+01:00</published><updated>2019-08-29T19:32:00+01:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/libertybellenewsletter/libertybelle/2019/08/29/risking-the-red-zone</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/libertybellenewsletter/libertybelle/2019/08/29/risking-the-red-zone.html">&lt;h2&gt;From Brighouse to Leeds&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;12th - 20th August 2019&lt;/h2&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Leeds Dock.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst travelling along, we had been given notification by the Canal &amp;amp; River Trust that two flood locks ahead of us were closed due to the river water being dangerously high. We decided to stay in Brighouse whilst we waited for the water level to go down. We had a relaxing day, running a few errands and then having a delicious meal at Garry and Helen's cooked for us by the lovely Molly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following morning we were able to move off again, the flood locks having been re-opened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initially we continued with our 'short lock technique' but the locks were getting longer and soon we no longer needed to take special measures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The weather was kind to us and we enjoyed being back in the land of the kingfisher and heron.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n57/P1260144.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Looking back to the canal lock on the left and the river to the right.&quot; /&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n57/P1260161.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Liberty Belle passing under a bridge looking out for the turning onto the canal hidden in the river bank.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;On the river looking for the flood lock onto the canal. Somewhere on the right...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n57/P1260165.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The open flood lock to the canal.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;...Here it is!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;It's a good job it is open as there appears to be nowhere to pull over...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout Yorkshire we have been surrounded by Himalayan Balsam creating a hazey pink border to the canal. Pretty though they are, they have taken over from the variety of plants which might otherwise have been there.
Similarly, In the hills around us, the native heather is often fighting against rhododendron bushes. They too can look lovely but are crowding out the natural species of plants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To remind us that summer is coming to a close we had blackberries and bales of hay in the fields around us and the Black Headed Gulls have lost their signature summer plumage. Despite these signs, we still came across the occasional cygnet, duckling and young moorhen. We even saw a pair of moorhens building a nest!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Children of course are still on holiday and we came across groups of boys jumping into the canal from the locks. Not something we or the lock keepers were keen on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n57/P1260189.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A piar of swans and a relatively young cygnet.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;A late brood.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually we reached a lock opening out onto a stretch of river. The river level indicator was just touching the red zone, suggesting that the conditions were again becoming dangerous. We stopped for lunch and watched two other boats pass through the lock.
We discussed the situation...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stretch of river was only a mile long, we would be travelling with the river flow, it was only just in the red....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We checked the Canal &amp;amp; River Trust's website and there were no warnings about the flood lock (yet), so we took the chance and went for it..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We travelled along a little faster than usual due to the flow of the river, and kept a sharp eye open for trouble.
We could see the flood lock gates in the distance and they were shut.  The approach to the lock was tricky, with a weir immediately on the right and apparently no landing stage on the left until it was revealed at the last minute behind the weeds. It was obviously too short for us. Tony steered for it anyway, fighting with the weir which wanted to drag Liberty Belle towards it. He managed to force Liberty Belle's bow in the corner where the lock gate and landing stage met. I clambered off from the bow, taking the rope with me. After a struggle, Tony managed to straighten Liberty Belle up and I grabbed the middle rope, pulling her in. Tony had to walk along the gunwales from the stern to get off and tie her in place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lock gates were difficult and Tony had to give me a hand but, finally, we got off the river and into the lock. Shortly afterwards we were out on the other side, into the safety of the calm waters of the canal at Mirfield.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;River level in the Red Zone.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lock was closed to traffic by the following morning. With that experience behind us and more rain forecast, we decided to get as many of the river stretches behind us as we could before the river levels rose any more. This meant missing out a short canal arm to Dewsbury, which was a shame.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All went well until we reached a place called Horbury where the river level indicator was well into the red, so we moored up near a pub, prepared to wait as many days as it took for the level to go down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n57/P1260173.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A string of large orange buoys protecting boats on the canal from the nearby weir.&quot; /&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it turned out, we were able to move off the following day, the river level now being in the green! So we set off for Wakefield, a place I must admit I had not heard of but turned out to be a very pleasant surprise. We stayed for a couple of nights to give us a chance to look around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wakefield's Cathedral was particularly friendly and welcoming. We visited the cafe there for tea &amp;amp; cake and liked it so much we went back for lunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Wakefield museum was made especially interesting with its displays about the Victorian Eco-warrier, explorer, taxidermist and eccentric Charles Waterton.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;What a noise!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n57/DSCN2529.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The stone vaulted ceiling above the sanctuary of Wakefield cathedral.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Wakefield Cathedral has two contrasting ceilings. Above the alter it is organic-looking, as if the pillars have spread naturally overhead...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;...above the choir it is wooden,&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Wakefield Cathedral's 'ambo'. A cross between a lectern and a pulpit, it has casters that can be locked into place and an adjustable stand so that children can use it and still be seen. It is a work of art.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;... She looks like the criminal type.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After making the most of the lovely Wakefield, we set off early the next morning. In front of us was a long stretch of river that we had no intention of dawdling on in case the levels rose again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The river was wide and fed into a wide stretch of canal. The locks were massive and electrically controlled, so my job was easy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n57/P1260216.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The canal split in two and passing over two aqueducts.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Liberty Belle dwarfed by the lock.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;It makes a change from trying to fit in diagonally!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We arrived in Leeds and were lucky to find a 48 hour mooring in Leeds Dock within easy reach of the city centre. We got ourselves a map and some advice from the lovely lady in the tourist information office and off we went.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is beautiful architecture in abundance in Leeds. I started off photographing each interesting and lovely building but I eventually gave up and just looked. The Victorian and Edwardian shopping arcades are simply amazing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The museum somehow didn't quite grab us and we tip-toed around the Catholic Cathedral.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;A very pretty footbridge.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Lovely.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During our last evening in Leeds we were relaxing when we heard a strange thumping noise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Was it our water pump? No.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe it was a machine banging in posts...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It sounded like the dinosaur in Jurassic Park, gradually getting nearer and nearer...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually, we saw the cause. Drummers were leading an Indian wedding party to a restaurant opposite our moorings in Leeds Dock. There must have been three or four generations there, all dressed up and in dancing mood! The excitement and joy was infectious. As they enjoyed their party, we had an early night ready for the next day's cruising.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Where Next?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Leeds we will be turning the corner and heading West along the Leeds and Liverpool Canal over the Pennines. We are looking forward to the views and exploring more of Yorkshire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hope to arrive in Liverpool during the second week of September.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rachel Glombek</name></author><category term="LibertyBelle" /><summary type="html">From Brighouse to Leeds 12th - 20th August 2019</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Special Anniversary Edition</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/libertybellenewsletter/libertybelle/2019/08/23/special-anniversary-edition.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Special Anniversary Edition" /><published>2019-08-23T21:25:00+01:00</published><updated>2019-08-23T21:25:00+01:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/libertybellenewsletter/libertybelle/2019/08/23/special-anniversary-edition</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/libertybellenewsletter/libertybelle/2019/08/23/special-anniversary-edition.html">&lt;h2&gt;Special Anniversary Edition&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;23rd August 2018 - 23rd August 2019&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n56/DSCN2681.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Tony and Rachel on Liberty Belle a Saltaire&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;A year on&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wow! It was a whole year ago that we bought Liberty Belle and began our journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;We have travelled along 1163 miles of canal, through 1245 locks.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;We have discovered several ways to sink a canal boat and attempted two of them.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Liberty Belle has gained a few dents and lost some paint along the way.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;We have passed the time of day with lots of people and seen countless boats (mostly moored), some of them more than once!&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;We have visited hamlets, villages, towns &amp;amp; cities, museums, churches, minsters &amp;amp; cathedrals.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;We have weathered all kinds of weather including too hot, too cold, too wet and too windy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What an adventure!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Things we have learnt&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A plan rarely comes together&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;You should never pass a tap without topping up with water&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Steering in reverse is mostly a matter of luck&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Even if you think you don't need fenders at a mooring, you need fenders.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The BBC Weather App talks nonsense&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;There are a few narrow boats called Liberty Belle but most are called Carpe Diem, Narrow Escape or Meander&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;There are no Waitrose shops in the North&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;It's not what a museum has but how it presents it that is important.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Wet coal doesn't burn hot.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Coal is always wet because it is packed in special plastic bags that allow rain in but not out again.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;There is no time to learn a new language or read a book or practice the ukulele or do a crossword or embroider.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;It is possible for a couple to live on a narrow boat for a whole year and remain married...&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Just because there is a mooring space/toilet/elsan point/tap marked on the map, it isn't necessarily there.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Ducks are good mothers and geese are just shit machines&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Despite there being 34,000 canal boats registered there are hardly any actually moving on the canals. We can travel for days without meeting any! (There was a brief flurry one day in June..)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Our fears are usually unfounded.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A day isn't long enough, nor is a year...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Visitors&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We love having visitors! Some pop by for a cuppa, some visit for the day and others stay and travel with us. We don't always remember to take photos of our visitors but here are some we did take...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also had some near misses from Craig (passing by on a train), Aub (a day or so out of sync), Chris and Jan (unknowingly nearby in their camper van)...plus others, I'm sure!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Future Plans&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, bearing in mind that our plans rarely come together...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We intend to travel through Yorkshire, to Liverpool, Lancaster, Cheshire and Wales before heading south for the winter. We still need to study the winter lock stoppages but we think Milton Keynes will be a good winter base. We still have a lot of miles to explore so we will need at least one more summer....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Watch this space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Our travels so far.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;7th - 13th August 2019&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/maps/n55map.png&quot; alt=&quot;Our route&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Our route&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n55/DSCN2430.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Monica sat in the bow feeding ducks.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Monica feeding the ducks in Sowerby Basin&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Leaving Sowerby Bridge we were about to join the Calder &amp;amp; Hebble Canal which has very different locks to those we have been used to. Not only would they require the use of Tony's, (as yet un-tested), home-made hand-spike to operate the paddles but, to make things even more interesting, the locks are a bit too short for Liberty Belle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Great care and vigilance would be needed to prevent her getting her bow caught on the walking platforms of the bottom gates, or her stern on the cill of the top gates....  No pressure!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, with all this excitement ahead of us, Liberty Belle was glad to have Neil and Monica as extra crew.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our first task was to turn Liberty Belle and manoeuvre her into the boatyard so that we could top up our water and diesel, and replaced our empty gas bottle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We met a gentleman there who had cycled 3 miles from his boat to the boatyard to purchase two hand-spikes. I took the opportunity to compare Tony's hand-made one with the genuine article and it looked remarkably similar...thankfully!&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;In the distance, the Wainhouse Tower, built as a chimney for the dye works but never used, it is now a visitor attraction, open on Bank Holidays only.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before braving the first lock we turned up the Halifax Arm to Salterhebble Basin, in the hope of finding something interesting. It was quite pretty but, being next to the sewage works, was a bit stinky. Needless to say, we had the moorings to ourselves!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The canal arm stopped here and there was a footpath following the route of the old canal to Halifax, which we followed to the Shears Inn...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The Shears Inn, a surprise amongst all the industrial buildings.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the temptations offered by the Shears Inn we had our lunch back at the boat. Fortified we felt ready to negotiate the tricky turn into the first lock. Once in position, Tony tied up Liberty Belle and had the honour of being the first to try his hand-spike. We were all relieved to see that it worked.... Phew!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n55/P1260081.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Tony using his Calder and Hebble Handspike in the lock mechanism.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Tony wielding the hand-spike.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within the lock, Liberty Belle was deftly manoeuvred by Tony at the helm and Neil at the bow rope, under the watchful eyes of the rest of the crew wielding the windlass and hand-spike....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The locks are short but wide. The 'trick' is to initially position Liberty Belle in the centre of the lock, with her bow positioned in the 'v' shape where the bottom gates meet, between the two protruding platforms sticking out of the gates. (These platforms are for the person wielding the windlass to stand on whilst lifting the paddles to let out the water).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile her stern is poised dangerously above the cill - a solid lump at the base of the top gates which they sit on to create a seal. (If you remember back to last year, that is what Liberty Belle was caught on when she nearly sank the first time...)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the water begins to drain from the lock, Liberty Belle is lowered and her bow is soon low enough to be pulled into the corner of the lock, underneath one of the projecting platforms, using her bow rope. At the same time, the helmsman moves the stern across to the opposite corner, thus moving in front of the white line that indicates the extremity of the cill and safety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the lock is empty, one of the bottom gates needs to be opened for Liberty Belle to be driven out. As her bow is now behind one of the gates, there is no choice but to open the other. Her bow rope needs to be passed to the opposite side of the lock so that, once the gate is open, she can be hauled from behind the other gate into the gap and freedom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n55/DSCN2484.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Liberty Belle butted against the lock gate between two walkway platforms.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Bow against the lock gates...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n55/DSCN2479.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Liberty Belle's stern butted against the rear lock gates.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;...and stern over the cill line.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our first attempt was a success! We worked as a team as we travelled through the following four locks and our technique was perfected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n55/DSCN2481.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Liberty Belle's bow rope draped over the lock gate for use later.&quot; /&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Pushing the stern away from the cill using the boathook.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Excuse the backside! Easing my way across the lock gates with the bow rope, ready to pull the bow from behind the gate.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Pencils driven into stumps. There were at least a dozen of these along the canal.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;No idea why.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We arrived in Elland and found a mooring outside the 'Barge &amp;amp; Barrell'. From here we were able to catch up with Garry and Helen again who were kind enough to invite us all into their home for a delicious meal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following day it was time for us to say goodbye to Neil and Monica, who were moving on to the Lake District. They promised to catch up with us again sometime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n55/P1260114.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Liberty Belle moored in Elland Basin with two accompanying swans.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Swans begging for bread at the mooring in Elland.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We stayed at our moorings in Elland for a few days, exploring the local hills, shops and pubs with Garry and Helen as our guides. It is so easy to fall in love with Yorkshire and we are smitten.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of our walks took us up over the hills and back to Halifax where we had another look around and watched some of the Calderdale Pride celebrations in the pouring rain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another took us back above Halifax and then into Brighouse where we were able to check out the mooring possibilities and have a preview of the locks we were going to negotiate the following day, without our extra crew!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result of the locking technique we had perfected with Neil &amp;amp; Monica, as well as our preview of the locks, we travelled to Brighouse without incident.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The town proved to have everything we could possibly need to replenish our supplies but most importantly it was close enough for Mary's friends Anne and Mark to visit us. It was lovely to see them and we hope they will come and find us again, although we may have put them off with our stories of nearly sinking....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;7th August 2019&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst we were moored in Sowerby Bridge, we were so close to Halifax that we decided to go there for the day and explore. To save our feet for the tourist trail, we opted for the short train ride rather than the steep climb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our day was full of historical interest. It began by crossing over an interesting cobbled iron footbridge on our way to Sowerby Bridge railway station. Once at the station we had numerous information boards detailing the histories of local people and buildings to keep us amused whilst waiting for our train.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n54/IMG_20190807_102101.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A cast iron footbridge with panels of vertical rods and a cross with curved cast iron crosspieces.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;A cobbled, iron footbridge.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;An information board about the Rochdale Canal.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Halifax itself there are so many interesting places to visit that we were spoilt for choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The beautiful old Halifax railway station building has been replaced by a smaller, modern building. It is now part of the 'Eureka!' complex, the National Children's Museum, which all looks very exciting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the front of the old building is a depiction of John the Baptist carved in stone. More of him later...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n54/DSCN2336.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The old classically styled railway station and new glass building housing the Eureka museum&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;'Eureka!'&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Halifax Minster is dedicated to St. John the Baptist (of course).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Inside we could have paid £3 for a licence to take photos but we were too mean...)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The magnificent wooden ceiling is divided into squares, each one with a coat of arms painted within it. Each of the pews has a little entry gate. I studied these in the hope of finding some indication of individual families having marked them as their own but was disappointed. However, I then found, at the back of the minster, a display of brass plaques which had been removed from the pews, each one with the name of an individual, family or organisation. A few were dated, the oldest being 1699.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tony was impressed by the memorial of an Archbishop of Dublin who specified in his will that his heart and bowels should be interred in the Halifax Minster, whilst the rest of his remains went elsewhere. He has decided that his own will is not nearly complicated enough...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Piece Hall was a welcome refuge for us from the rain. This amazing building, consisting of a sloping square surrounded by individual rooms on 3 floors, was originally built in the 1700's as a market place for cloth. Halifax was famous for its wool cloth. It was woven by local people into 'pieces' 30 yards long and the width of a standard loom. Each 'piece' took one weaver a whole week to produce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each salesman had one of the 315 rooms in the Piece Hall from which he would sell his weavers' 'pieces' from 10-12 on Saturday mornings. This short window in which to purchase the cloth helped to keep the prices high. (Besides, the rest of the week was needed to produce more 'pieces'...)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The building was only used for it's original purpose for 40 years because the large industrial mills took over from the individual spinners and weavers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the Piece Hall has interesting shops and cafes as well as a museum. It's square is the venue for concerts, markets and art installations. It is well worth a visit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Halifax's elaborate Town Hall was designed by the same man, (Charles Barry), who designed The Houses of Parliament. Even the fabulous exterior cannot prepare you for the extravagant design of its central Victoria Hall which takes your breath away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing that became apparent was that Halifax is obsessed with St. John the Baptist who's head, according to local legend, was buried here. His 'likeness' crops up everywhere (often with dripping blood detail) but especially in the Town Hall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As well as their favourite saint, the Town Hall also likes to incorporate their town's initial letter in the decoration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had a quick look around the indoor market which appears to be thriving. The stalls themselves were no more remarkable than in other towns but the building which houses them is beautiful with elaborate entry gates, a central clock, glass ceiling and red dragons!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dean Clough Mill is enormous but a fraction of its original size. It used to be the worlds largest carpet mill but is now a centre for business and the arts. It houses art galleries, which we didn't have time to do justice to, as well as a small theatre.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you Halifax, we had a great day out. We didn't have time to see everything of interest so Tony and I certainly intend to return.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The perfect end to the perfect day was our meal in the very popular Syhiba Restaurant back in Sowerby Bridge. We had the biggest Naan I have ever seen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On our way back to the boat we passed the Loose Goose Inn, outside of which were loads of geese, taking up half of the road.  How appropriate!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;21st July - 7th August 2019&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/maps/n53map.png&quot; alt=&quot;Our route&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Our route&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n53/P1250926.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Liberty Belle temporarily moored in a short side arm with part of a crane post protruding from the ground.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;A pretty mooring.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leaving Summit we shared locks with a boat called Amy that we had first seen moored in Littleborough. Amy had been commandeered by the Canal &amp;amp; River Trust to enable some of their engineers to carry out a visual check of the local canal and locks. They were on their way to pick them up a few locks further down the canal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On our way, the water level in one of the pounds between two locks was so low that there was not enough water to float the boats. This was odd as we had recently had so much water that it was flowing over the tops of the gates. We let the two boats down and they lingered in front of the lock whilst we opened both back and front paddles to let extra water through, allowing just enough for the boats to make their way along the centre of the pound in single file to the next lock, without depriving the pound above of too much water. The boats kept to the middle of the canal and eventually made their way into the next lock. Phew.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n53/P1250939.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Water flowing over the top of a pair of lock gates into the lock.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Excess water flooding over the top of the lock gates.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n53/DSCN2272.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Liberty Belle carefully making its way trhough a canal pound with low water levels and mud showing by the bank.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Lack of water in the pound - note the mud on the right.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later, (after Amy had moored to wait for the engineers), we were in a lock when an enthusiastic local woman came to tell us to look out for a large deer with impressive antlers at the top of the next hill. We left Liberty Belle sitting in the lock and took the binoculars. The stag was magnificent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n53/P1250937cropped.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A flightly fuzzy zoomed photo of a stag with huge antlers.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The magnificent stag.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the next lock the ground paddle was too stiff to wind, so I opened the one on the other side but this was insufficient and the gate would not open. Some onlookers, working in a garden on the hill just above us, shouted down that the gate would not open unless I had both paddles open. I explained that the other paddle was too stiff, so they headed down the hill, two men and a boy. In order to demonstrate how impossible it was to wind the other paddle, I walked around the lock and over the bridge to the other side. Needless to say the paddle came up beautifully with no effort required at all. Typical. The more I insisted that it was stuck when I first tried it, the more sceptical they looked!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two men went back to their work leaving the young boy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To change the subject away from my inadequate lock winding, I asked him if he had seen the stag. Yes, of course. The field we had seen it in belonged to his family and the deer regularly visit their goats there. He also explained that they intended to breed the goats so needed to buy a Billy goat and that Hebden Bridge, where we were headed, is known for its duck race. He was a very pleasant and informative young man.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n53/P1250985.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The third stonemason's mark is a cross with an 'L' shape underneath making it look a little like a windmill.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Windmill&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n53/P1250986.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The fourth stonemasons mark is a triangle with a line from the centre of its shorte sign making it look like a comtemporary computer mouse pointer.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Mouse pointer!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We moored at lunch time and managed to get the stern grounded in the process. Oh well.
It began to rain heavily (again), so we stayed at our mooring and got used to the odd angle of the boat!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n53/P1250956.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Liberty Belle in a lock. The lock wall has a lock gate sized indentation a little way from the end.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The locks in this area have been extended.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The indent in the wall shows where the old gates used to be.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n53/P1260004.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A hill beside the canal with a tall round chimney and a stone tower at the end of a mill.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Industrial buildings in a beautiful landscape.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following day, hoping that the water levels wouldn't be low again, we set off to get through the 12 locks to Todmorden. Apart from getting myself covered in black grease which had mysteriously got caked onto the operating mechanisms, all went well until the very last lock...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n53/P1250992.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A long, tall black brick wall beside the canal.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The Great Wall of Tod.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The wall flanking the canal approaching Todmorden.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;(It supports the railway line.)&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lock in the centre of Todmorden is a guillotine lock. The top gate and its paddles are operated by hand, as usual, but the bottom gate is electronically operated from a press-button panel which had rather a lot of instructions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We got Liberty Belle into the lock in the normal manner and closed the gates behind her. The water level here was high and it was pouring over the top gate, so Liberty Belle was as high in the lock as it was possible to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went to read the instructions.... I read them a couple of times and realised that the paddles to release the water from the lock had to be operated manually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Tony popped over to see what the delay was and Liberty Belle drifted diagonally in the lock, which wouldn't normally be a problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started to operate the paddles, the water began to leave the lock and Liberty Belle began to lower with the water. Well, most of her did but her bow was caught on the side of the lock! She was suddenly at a very precarious angle, with the stern almost under water...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I let down the paddles as quickly as I could to prevent more water from leaving and dashed over to the other end of the lock to raise the paddle there to let water in, (my shirt getting caught in the mechanism and ripping up the front in the process...) and hopefully raise Liberty Belle before she was completely engulfed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, Tony realised what was happening. Not wishing to go down with the ship, he scampered along the gunwales and jumped off. He tried to push her bow off the side of the lock but she remained stuck fast. He shouted to me to hurry, convinced that it was too late and all was lost.

&lt;p&gt;At the last second, Liberty Belle started to rise and right herself. Wow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, with Liberty Belle straightened, her bilge checked for water, the onlookers entranced and our hearts in our mouths we started the process again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time the process went ahead as it should but the gate would not open. The onlookers got involved. Everyone studied the instructions and offered advice. We decided that the water leaking into the lock over the top of the gates was keeping it topped up enough to prevent the lock gate sensors from allowing the gate to operate.&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;Tony phoned the number displayed on the control panel for assistance and help was summoned.
In the meantime we tried again. This time it opened, at last.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We must have been in that lock for 40 minutes before we finally escaped! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we moored up just beyond the lock, we had a return phone call telling us that help was on its way.  Tony nonchalantly assured them that we no longer needed any assistance....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were under the gaze of people eating in canal-side restaurants and cafes in the middle of Todmorden. I was full of adrenaline, a bit manic, covered in black grease and only just wearing my shirt. I must have been a scary sight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tony and I went off to Todmorden's micro-pub to celebrate still being alive and still having a boat...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n53/P1250995.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;rachel stood by the lock operating instructions, reading.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Carefully studying the instructions...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n53/P1250996.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Liberty Belle leaving the lock under the raised guillotine gate.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Blessed release!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n53/IMG-20190801-WA0001.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Tony returning from the bar with a glass of beer and a pot of nuts!&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;A pint and a bowl of wild garlic roasted nuts,&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;just the thing.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;very tasty, award winning sausages!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our next stop was at Stubbings Wharf, just outside Hebden Bridge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst at Stubbings Wharf we were informed that the canal ahead was closed due to the demolition of an old mill that a fire had rendered unstable. Sad though it was for the majestic old building, this enabled us to legitimately outstay our mooring restriction of 24 hours...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hebden Bridge is a well kept little place with historical buildings, interesting shops, buskers, a market and a wealth of cafes and restaurants. We spent a couple of days exploring the local area (and pubs...) with Garry and Helen as our guides, and then picked up our new temporary crew members, Neil and Monica.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n53/DSCN2280.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Tony and Rachel part way up a steep cobbled path.&quot; /&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;just straight up, whatever the angle.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After showing Neil and Monica around Hebden Bridge, our first task was to move through 3 locks to the boaters' facilities. Having achieved this, Tony then squeezed Liberty Belle into a very tight mooring space, bumper to bumper between two other boats. (One owner, just locking up his boat, loitered outside to make sure we didn't do any damage.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seemingly thrilled with their short trip, Neil &amp;amp; Monica treated us to a delicious evening meal in a local Greek restaurant. Yummm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was much excitement ahead for Liberty Belle and her crew. We had Tuel Lock in Sowerby Bridge to pass through. It is the deepest lock on the canal network, manned by a volunteer lock keeper and passage through needs to be booked ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a fortifying breakfast we set off. On arrival the lock keeper said he needed no assistance so we could all stay on board for the full experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n53/P1260041.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Monica, Neil and Tony (making a Benny Hill comical salute) at the stern of Liberty Belle as she descends the lock.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Going down!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n53/P1260050.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Monica, Neil and Tony at the stern of Liberty Belle dwarfed by the lock gates as she leaves the lock.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Leaving Tuel Lock.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;You can just see the tiny Monica, Neil and Tony at the stern
with the gates towering above them.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were expecting to operate the next lock on our own but were met by several Canal &amp;amp; River Trust engineers who were trying to establish why a section of the lock side had collapsed into a large hole. They operated the lock slowly whilst they carried out their investigation. We were thanked for our patience but we were just glad to be released safely...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n53/P1260055.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Three engineers inspect the hole in the ground and the lowering water klevels in the lock with Neil, Monica and Rachel observing.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Watching the engineers...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We found a mooring around the corner in Sowerby Basin, opposite the boatyard. It wasn't perfect, being on a bend, but it was good enough and we were able to watch a little creature busying himself around the basin, in and out of the water. At first we thought it was a ferret but it turned out to be a small, wild, chocolate coloured mink. Very much a pest but still fun to watch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tony had taken the opportunity earlier in the week to order, online, some new filters for Liberty Belle's engine from a local supplier, knowing that he would soon be within walking distance to collect them. The supplier had been so surprised that a man who had a Southampton postcode was coming to Halifax to collect his order just to save £6 on postage, that he rang him up to check that he hadn't made a mistake... Off Tony went up an almost vertical hill towards Halifax to collect his purchase - it took him rather longer than he had thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we were so close to Halifax, we decided to go there for the day. But that's another story...&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;xmp&gt;
We’re going to walk to Todmorden.

We’re going to go the high way.
 

We’re not daunted!

What a beautiful day!
 

Up the rickety steps,

Woops, whoa, hup!
 

Along the nettle-y path,

Ouch, ooch, ouuch!
 

Past the reversing trucks,

Beep, beep, beep!
 

Up the tarmac’d lane,

March, march, march
 

What’s happened to our path?

Huh? Where? Back there!
 

Back down the tarmac’d lane,

Huff, huff, huff.
 

Up the steep track,

Puff, puff, puff
 

Onto the boggy path,

Squelch, squelch, squelch
 

Stop and look at the views,

Wow, wow, wow!
 

Watch the wind-farm blades,

Spin, spin, spin.
 

Follow the reservoir walk,

Stride, step, stride.
 

Turn onto the stone-flagged path,

Clomp, clomp, clomp.
 

Up onto Gaddings Dam,

Stroll, amble, stroll.
 

Look again at the views,

Gosh, wow, gosh!
 

It’s the highest ever beach*,

Where? There? How?
 

Lookout, here come the cows!

Quick, move, go!
 

Down the stone steps,

Careful, one at a time..
 

Down the steep rugged path,

Woops, steady, woah!
 

Down the flights of steps,

Step after step after step...
 

Over the stone canal bridge,

Trip, trap, trip.
 

Time for a little snack I think,

Slurp, chomp, slurp.
 

Charity shop DVD’s,

4 for £1? Yes please.
 

Hide under the stall from the rain,

Drip, drop, drip.
 

Share our fish and chips,

Chomp, chomp, chomp.
 

Back over the canal bridge,

Trip, trap, trip.
 

Along the wet towpath

Splash, splosh, splish.

 

Past the curious dog,

Sniff, snuff, sniff.
 

Sorry, we've eaten all the chips,

Sniff, oh, sniff.
 

Past the reversing trucks,

Beep, beep, beep.
 

Along the nettle-y path,

Ouch, ooch, ouuch!
 

Down the rickety steps,

Woops, whoa, steady!
 

Back onto the boat, 

Have you got the key?
 

Who’s first for the loo?

Me, me, meee!
 

What a wonderful walk.

Look at all that rain!
 

Thankfully back before the storm.

Is it time for tea?
&lt;/xmp&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*Gaddings Dam was built in 1833 high above Todmorden to create a reservoir to supply the local mills. When the mills began to use steam power, the reservoir fell into disuse. Under threat of being drained in 2001 the reservoir was rescued by a determined group of locals who bought the dam, repaired it, and now continue to maintain it. There is a small sandy beach in one corner much loved by the local families who heroically climb the steep, rocky path to the top of the moor to play there and swim in the water. It can get very busy in the hot weather! How wonderful is that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;21st June - 13th July 2019&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/maps/n50map.png&quot; alt=&quot;Our route&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Our route&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n50/P1250282.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A steam train passing Hatton&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The railway track often follows the canal, side by side, so trains are a common sight for us but a steam train is a real treat!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, where were we? Oh yes, Leamington Spa...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our week in Cornwall was so delightful that we extended it to almost 2 weeks..! We finally arrived back in Leamington Spa to find Liberty Belle safe and sound, (if a little dusty), exactly where we had left her. Phew!&lt;p /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our first jobs were to get the washing done and to do some food shopping, so we went to Morrisons. Yes, Morrisons in Leamington Spa has a launderette! The washing machine sends you a text message when it has almost finished so that you can go and get your shopping done whilst you wait. How amazing is that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n50/IMG-20190621-WA0004.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The self service laundrette in the Morrisons car park&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Morrisons in Leamington Spa is just yards from the canal and has this amazing facility. It's surprising the things that get me excited these days...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Garry, Helen and Jack were hot on our heels. Travelling from the campsite in Cornwall back to Yorkshire, they stopped off to spend a couple of days with us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all cruised along the Saltisford Arm to spend the day exploring sunny Warwick, finishing our very pleasant day with an evening BBQ at our delightful mooring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n50/P1250270cropped.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Helen and Garry peering over the front of the boat&quot; /&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Visitors!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Jack, relaxing&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n50/P1250268.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The bridge over the Saltisford canal arm&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Owned by the Saltisford Canal Trust Ltd,
this little canal arm has delightful moorings.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n50/P7052473.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Rachel and Helen outside the ancient timer framed Lord Leycester hospital&quot; /&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n50/P7052475.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Warwick Castle from Mill Street&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The best view we could find of Warwick Castle without spending £29 each...!!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following day, despite the rain, we all faced the Hatton flight of 21 locks, Garry attacking them with gusto, shooting us along the canal to our mooring near Hatton railway station. From here, Garry, Helen and Jack continued their journey North, promising to catch up with us again in Yorkshire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n50/P7062483.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Some of the 21 loack on the Hatton flight&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n50/P7062484.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Garry winding the locks so fast that he is just a blurr&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Garry is just a blurr...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tony left from Hatton too, catching the train back to the house to get some weeding done. So, suddenly alone, I took the opportunity to give Liberty Belle a bit of a Spring clean (better late than never!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In between cleaning jobs, I had a little look around at Hatton, hoping to find a nice loaf of bread. The village itself is very small with a pretty church, (closed). It has lots of mature Limeflower trees in the churchyard and lining the main road, which smelt lovely. However, as far as I could tell, it doesn’t have a shop of any kind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the opposite side of the canal is an old farm which is now Hatton shopping village, restaurant, cafe, hairdressers, children’s adventure park, garden centre, swimming pool, escape room, woodland school....complete with a very large car park. Sadly I couldn’t find a single thing to buy, certainly not some bread.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further along the canal, over the top of a tunnel, is the village of Shrewley, so I wandered along to see what was for sale there. I was encouraged by a sign directing me to the Village Deli. Ah, now we’re talking! Unfortunately, their idea of a deli and mine didn’t seem to match. What they meant was a village store selling packaged sandwiches and pies…. Hmmm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to do without bread.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n50/IMG_20190711_114932.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Rachel cream tea at the Hatton Locks Cafe&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;No bread? Eat scones...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n50/IMG_20190707_184142.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The canal around the boat is covered in blue-green algae&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Blue-Green algae on the march...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tony finally came back 5 days later, not because the weeding was finished but because we needed to get moving if we were to get through Manchester before the schools broke up for the summer! Creating mayhem for boaters is a holiday pastime along the canals in Manchester...our guide book suggests boaters start the 15 locks along the Aston Canal into Manchester before 10 am and to avoid school holidays. We had 2 weeks, which was a bit tight...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n50/P1250303.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The twin Shrewley tunnels. A large one for boats and a smaller one above and to the side for horses&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Shrewley has two tunnels, one for boats and one for horses (or pedestrians).&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Originally the horse would have been unhitched and the boaters would have to 'leg it' through tunnels.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;This involved lying on the top of the boat and walking your legs along the inside of the tunnel. Teams of local men could be employed for this purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n50/P1250293.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The smaller stone horse tunnel with ribbed flour for the horse to get a grip&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n50/P1250314.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The bank of the canal narrowed by a landslide&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;A landslide making the canal rather narrow.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It felt good to be on the move again. The weather was calm and sunny, and we spotted two kingfishers during the morning. Lovely. The canal was lined with Buddleia, willowherbs and Meadowsweet, intertwined with a pretty purple vetch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We made brief stops at Kingswood Junction, (to use the facilities there) and Knowle, (where they do know what a Deli is...).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n50/P1250338.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A cast iron bridge over a lock with a narrow gap in the middle&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Kingswood Jumction has fine examples of split bridges over the locks which allowed the rope between the horse and boat to pass through without unhitching...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n50/P1250342.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A white-washed canalside cottage with a curved roof and more modern flat-roofed extension&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;....as well as a barrel roofed lock keepers cottage.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soon the countryside was left behind as we got closer to Birmingham.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Travelling through Birmingham has previously been a pleasant experience, but worrying about Manchester had made me nervous of city locks. On top of that, the weather had taken a turn and the wind was beginning to affect the steering. On balance, I decided that I was more nervous of crashing Liberty Belle than meeting 'undesirables' at the locks so Tony took the helm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n50/P1250375.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A brick brigde over the canal with two red iron doors connecting to the road above&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Getting closer to the city where the road bridges were built with access hatches to enable fire engines to take up canal water.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n50/P1250383.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A gently sloping brick bridge take the towpath over a side arm&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;One of the many bridges along the towpath in Birmingham built to span the side arms to factories, mills and warehouses.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n50/P1250387.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A cast iron bridge number sign reading '88F'&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;This illustrates how many bridges have been built over the canal since the original bridge 88!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n50/P1250329.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The name on the side of a narrowboat reads 'Wideman on a Narrowboat'&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Hahaha!! We didn't see him but took his word for it!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It all started well but eventually, whilst waiting for a lock to be ready, Liberty Belle was blown against the side of a bridge with quite a thump. She lost some paint and her chimney cover was crushed... Luckily the top of the stove flue remained undamaged. That sort of thing isn't good for the nerves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple of locks later, I could see from a distance that there was a group of young men gathered there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh dear, here we go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Try to look calm and relaxed...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I got closer I could see that they were a group of six young men, in their late teens or early twenties sitting in a tight circle, discussing something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remain calm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the young men turned to look at me and I smiled. He smiled back and turned back to his group. So far so good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok...just operate the lock and try not to attract attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I overheard some of their chat. Something about buying and selling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trying to look as if I was only interested in the lock, I took a quick look into the centre of the group...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What a shock! They were playing Monopoly! Yes, really! In this wind! No wonder they were keeping their group tight, they didn't want the money to be blown away...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All my nerves were released in a loud guffaw! They weren't sure what was so funny, but smiled politely...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We made it through Birmingham without further incident. I just hope our experience in Manchester is just as good and that the young people are as busy with board games as those in Birmingham...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n50/P1250413.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Colourful graffiti on the side of a bridge reading 'iBS'&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The good folk of Birmingham appear to have a strangely celebratory attitude to Irritable Bowel Syndrome...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Are we in the correct lane?&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Under we go....&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n50/P1250409.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;and on top of the tunnel as we emerge, black corrugated iron industrial buildings&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;...and out again.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
