&lt;h2&gt;23rd March 2020 onwards&lt;/h2&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Our mooring in Sunbury.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There we were in Kingston Upon Thames as the restrictions for limiting the virus were coming into effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cathy managed to book herself a train journey from Kingston on Thames for the morning after we arrived there. Luckily she made it home before the lockdown came into effect and avoided being stranded with us. A holiday is one thing, but that might have been a step too far for her!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After waving Cathy off, we joined the socially distanced queue outside Waitrose and stocked up on groceries. Then we went for a walk, following the Thames to Richmond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Walking down Richmond Hill.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We stayed a second night in Kingston and then moved on to Sunbury. On the way a moored boater shouted a warning that the lock we were approaching was closed due to a sunken boat blocking passage. Oh heck! He managed to pass on directions to some pleasant 24 hour moorings at the edge of a tiny public park. That was good of him because the mooring on the lock approach was full.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it happened, the following morning we received instructions from the Canal &amp;amp; River Trust and the Environment Agency to stop moving, along with the news that all mooring restrictions were now lifted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the terms of our 'continuous cruiser' licence we are normally obliged to move regularly, observing the mooring restrictions of up to 14 days in one place and travelling at least 25 miles in a year. This obviously suited us under normal circumstances. Now that the circumstances were far from normal, we were obliged to remain where we were.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We could have chosen at this stage to go back to our house but we have someone living there at the moment so we were concerned about the domino effect that our return would cause. Plus, Liberty Belle is on a mooring where the water levels alter daily and we would have had no way of checking on her for an unknown amount of time. So, with all things considered, we decided to stay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank goodness we didn't wait for a less windy day to travel the tidal section of the Thames, otherwise we would have been in the London Docklands area when we were asked to stop travelling, which may not have been quite as pleasant.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Our nearest bridge over the Thames is Walton Bridge.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;This is the 6th Walton Bridge. Whatever do they do with them?&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course we are allowed to move Liberty Belle to fetch water and to empty the loo...! This involves a 6 mile round trip back to Molesey Lock, where the nearest facilities are. We cannot turn around this side of the lock because there is a danger of getting sucked against the weir, so we have to actually pass through the lock, turn on the other side and go straight back into the lock to operate it again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under normal circumstances, this large lock is electrically operated but now we have to use a wheel and levers which operate it hydraulically. This is to deter people from using it and to lessen the need for a lock keeper to be present.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The once-a-week water ritual seems to take for ever and is no small effort, but we are in no rush...&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;These Egyptian Geese have produced a family, unlike the pair at our mooring.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Two of the many tufted ducks in the area, but none of them come to visit us...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from the concerns that we all have at this time, we also wonder what we will do if we run out of cooking gas or diesel... Having investigated, Tony has located a chap that will deliver gas, so we hope he is still operating when we need him. We think we have enough coal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are safe, comfortable and feeling lucky. We are moored against a narrow public park where people come to feed the ducks, geese and swans. Liberty Belle is positioned at the end of the park where there is no reason for people to walk past us, so we have quite a private section of path at the back of the boat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within walking distance we have a choice of supermarkets, some bins and a few small green spaces. We have a routine of sorts, which mainly revolves around meal times and our 3 o'clock bun!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our boaty neighbour is a friendly chap trying to cope with two dogs that are used to rather more freedom. He takes them to a nearby park where they can take a dip in the river. He is only a short distance from his private moorings which are unfortunately the other side of the sunken boat...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from our human visitors to the park we have a pair each of swans, Egyptian Geese and Mandarin ducks, several parakeets, Canada Geese, Mallards and black headed gulls, and a squirrel to watch, with regular appearances by a Great Crested Grebe, a cormorant, a swimmer, stand-up paddle boarders, kayakers, rowing boats and a chap on a hydroplane board. (A passer-by and I decided the hydroplaner must be James Bond, currently furloughed.) Tony has also seen a kingfisher on several occasions which only goes to prove that he has the best seat in the boat.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Tony spotted this visitor to the Middle Thames Yacht Club opposite us.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Presumably it is quieter there than usual. He's not been seen since, but it doesn't mean he's not there...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Well..&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;..I did some of the sanding down.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;(Honestly, it's iced-tea)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know some of you will be busier than you have ever been but if others of you have run out of things to do, you can always read the newsletter archive - just click on the blue button on the top of this email. The archive follows the format of a blog which means the most recent entry is at the top, so, to read them in the correct order, you can click on the word 'Posts' on the top right, then choose the top title, which is the first entry from August 2018. That lot should keep you busy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will send another newsletter when I have anything to report...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No fever to report yet, except maybe a touch of cabin fever...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(If we do catch the virus, I will blame the Tesco shoppers.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have now run out of excuses and have started to address Liberty Belle's rust patches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look after yourselves. Tony and I welcome emails, it would be lovely to hear from you.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Lets just check how it is before we commit ourselves!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;conversationtalk&quot;&gt;&quot;London VTS, this is Narrow Boat Liberty Belle. Over&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;conversationlisten&quot;&gt;&quot;crackle....crackle....narrow bo....hiss...crackle....hiss...&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;conversationtalk&quot;&gt;&quot;London VTS, this is Narrow Boat Liberty Belle. Repeat please. Over&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;conversationlisten&quot;&gt;&quot;crackle....crackle....Liberty Belle...hiss...crackle....hiss...&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;conversationtalk&quot;&gt;&quot;London VTS, this is Liberty Belle. We are a fifty-eight foot narrow boat with three people on board about to enter the River Thames from Limehouse Lock. Out&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n74/P1300169.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;2&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The Limehouse Lock Keeper opens the gates...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With my heart in my mouth, my toes curled and my body tense, (as if on board an out-of-control roller coaster), I stood on the back of Liberty Belle, with Tony and Cathy, as we went through Limehouse Lock and onto the massive River Thames.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tony had the radio clipped to himself, and the instructions for passing under each of the first 29 bridges were printed off, put into plastic wallets and held fast in front of us with a strong magnet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our main concern was an engine breakdown, when we would need to deploy our possibly inadequate anchor. Our boat purchase survey simply noted &quot;There is a small anchor&quot;, which doesn't fill you with confidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was scary but wonderful!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;6th - 21st March 2020&lt;/h2&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Our route&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;

 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n73/P1290876cropped.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;At last, I managed to take a photo of a kingfisher!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the train window, on our journey back to Hertford, we could see that the Weeping Willows were declaring the start of spring with their stunningly bright green leaves. Maybe the winter was gradually petering out. Realistically we know that March weather can be tricky, giving you spring one minute and winter the next, so we weren't completely fooled, but it was cheering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We found Liberty Belle as we had left her. Well, almost. A neighbouring boater had moved us slightly, so there was an unfamiliar knot in our bow rope, but she was safe and sound.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had a few days left of our allotted 14, so we stayed and explored locally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n73/IMG_20200307_143001596.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;2&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Liberty Belle moored alongside the allotments.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;A cheeky moorhen on top of a garden wall helping itself from the bird feeder!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On one of our walks we took a picnic with us but, as we drew closer to a country pub, we talked ourselves into a Sunday roast...Mmmmm! By the time we got there we were really ready for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sadly, the pub was closed &quot;Due to staff holiday&quot; and wasn't due to open again until 23rd March. Hmmmm...
We carried on along our path to the next pub. Here they didn't do food. Oh well, they had excellent beer and crisps! As we finished our treat, the sky darkened, so we ate our sandwiches as we walked back to the boat, expecting it to rain any moment. We got back just in time to shelter from the worst of the weather.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we finally left Hertford, turning the boat at the end of the navigation, we went back to Ware. It turned out to be a pretty town with an old priory, (now council owned with public access to the pleasant riverside grounds), and an excellent small museum run by volunteers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n73/P1290826.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;4&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Liberty Belle moored in Ware.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n73/P1290955.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;11&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;It used to be a major industry around here.
&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From our mooring in Ware, we decided to walk back to Hertford to the charity cafe that we had failed to visit when we were moored there. Every time we had tried it was either closed or too busy. This time we were in luck and it was just as nice as we had hoped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another walk took us to Hunsdon village. Here we sat on a bench in the memorial garden to drink our flask of cocoa. Behind us a young woman, with her baby strapped to her front and her phone on a tripod, was recording an inspirational message for her followers. Well, I think it was meant to be inspirational but it was in fact annoyingly high pitched, incessantly upbeat, extremely repetitive, very long and with hardly any content. When she finally finished, the contrasting quiet was shocking. We had finished our flask so we got up and left; quite quickly as it happened because she came down the same path immediately after us and we wanted to stay well ahead!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n73/IMG_20200311_103623646.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;12&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The village sign.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;A village hall, a spitfire and a rose.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Yep, that's it really.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n73/IMG_20200311_122925961.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;13&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;A pint of Hertford's McMullen, to recover from that woman!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before leaving Ware, we went for a short walk to look at some interesting buildings we had passed on the way. These turned out to be the remains of an old 19th century water mill, saved from redevelopment, with an explanatory plaque. It needs the plaque because there is very little left to see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n73/IMG_20200312_114720956.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;14&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Taking on water.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n73/IMG_20200312_092735184.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;15&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The site of the watermill.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we finally set off, we somehow managed to pass right by the boatyard that we had planned to stop at for fuel and moored near the turning for the River Stort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, the following morning, we turned Liberty Belle around, went past the boatyard again, turned at the next turning space and this time, stopped for fuel. Diesel for the engine, gas for the cooker and coal for the fire. Then off up the River Stort. It is narrow, winding and more natural looking than the Lee. Definitely worth the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n73/P1290858.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;16&quot; /&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;We were so busy admiring these trees that we missed the boatyard completely.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;We admired this new development alongside the river.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;In our opinion, nicely done.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile we had arranged to pick up Cathy at the top of the River Stort in Bishops Stortford. 
Due to the lack of mooring space, which is often a problem on rivers, we ended up travelling further each day than intended, so we made good time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, we did become a little concerned when we heard from a passer-by that there was a narrowboat straddling the river a couple of locks further along, preventing anyone from travelling. Oh great! We weren't sure how we were going to tackle the problem but assumed a plan would emerge when we reached it...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we did arrive at the offending boat, there was a man standing on its roof reaching for the centre rope, which he threw to a couple waiting on the bank. They then managed to pull the boat to the side. We pulled in just beyond it and offered the use of our mallet to re-secure the pins which were still attached to the back rope. It was a simple case of the pins having slipped out of damp ground, not pointless vandalism as one onlooker suggested. The helpful people were kayakers who couldn't get past the narrow boat, so had taken matters into their 
own hands. So that was a lot easier than we were expecting! Well done kayakers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n73/P1290961.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;28&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Kayakers to the rescue!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We headed straight for Bishops Stortford thinking that we would have to turn if there was no mooring space and get as close as we could. However we were delighted that we managed to moor just a short walk from the station. As usual, because we were in a reasonably large town, we made use of the launderette and went to the shops to restock. We were shocked to discover that the locusts had been! It was our first experience of shoppers panic buying and leaving the shelves bare. It took two and a half days for Tony to find us a packet of loo roll! (Luckily we had a stock of The Metro in reserve, that we could use in an emergency...)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On our first morning in Bishops Stortford, having decided that we would wait for our guest, Cathy, before eating our main meal, we decided to fortify ourselves with a Wetherspoons breakfast. Little did we know that this would be our last for some time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n73/IMG_20200316_124906854.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;29&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Moored in Bishop's Stortford.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our guest arrived safe and sound.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following morning, as soon as Tony had found a packet of loo rolls, (phew!), we left Bishops Stortford with Cathy at the helm. The mooring in Sawbridgeworth that we had used on the way up the river was occupied but we found a free space a little further down. After dinner we went for a stroll but didn't go into the local pub because we were all being advised against it. Oh well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n73/P1290967.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;30&quot; /&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;We took Cathy to see the sights in Sawbridgeworth.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;!?!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Harlow was our next stop. We walked into town through Town Park, a large public space owned by the council which was designed for the New Town of Harlow by Dame Sylvia Crowe in the 1950's. It has an outdoor paddling pool, a petting zoo, a lake, a skate park and cafe. It must have been fabulous in it's day and, although a bit dated, it is still a delightful place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We discovered a lovely looking coffee shop in town which wasn't at all busy so, taking hand washing and distancing seriously, we went in. The owner served us and explained that she had only been open 3 months. We discussed the growing coronavirus situation but she seemed upbeat and wasn't going to let all her hard work be for nothing. Fingers crossed for her (and everyone else).&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;...a delightful public space.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we were planning our trip on the tidal section of the River Thames, we initially thought we would quite like to go at 5 am, to avoid any other boats. However, the tides wouldn't be right for that time of the day, so we decided we would wait for a sunny day, with no wind, when the tide was not too strong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Cathy on board and due to go home on Monday, we made a snap decision to put aside our careful planning, take advantage of having an extra crew member and include Cathy in our exciting trip. Tony booked us in. We had 3 days to get to Limehouse Lock so we needed to get a move on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With us all taking turns to drive and do the locks we made good time and moored in Broxbourne.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here Cathy had her first 'shopping-in-a-crisis' experience. She went to find the ingredients for a tagine  and came back with the ingredients for a mushroom strogonoff. As you all know, flexibility was becoming key! Needless to say, it was delicious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n73/P1300032.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;39&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;...both good things in one place.
&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Broxbourne we teamed up with another boat to share the locks. This didn't last long because, unfortunately, he broke down. After towing him to the side, he assured us he would be able to fix it himself, so we were on our own again. As soon as we found what looked like safe moorings within an easy day's travel of Limehouse Dock, we stopped for the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following day, after a detour around Olympic Park, we arrived in Limehouse Dock, ready to go through the lock onto the Thames first thing in the morning, as planned. The sun was due to shine but the wind was forecast to be rather stronger than ideal...  We took a look at the river and it seemed remarkably calm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;18th - 25th February 2020&lt;/h2&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Bye, bye Merchants Square.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Joe, Kirsty and Carter on board, we left Paddington Basin behind, ready for the next part of our adventure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When our guests had joined us a few days before they had left their van in Hertford at the end of the Lee Navigation, so we spent the next few days travelling there, with the wind and rain trying hard to put us off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As soon as we had set off, Tony realised there was something missing from the top of the boat. Our gang plank!
Initially we thought it had been stolen but we eventually concluded that Storm Dennis was probably the culprit. Very annoying!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Things could be worse...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We turned onto the Regents Canal and were hoping to have a visit from John and Melissa on the way but it rained so heavily that they got soaked and sadly had to abandon the plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n72/IMG-20200219-WA0000.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;14&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;This was very tempting but we didn't have time to stop on the way.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Maybe on the way back? &lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn1&quot; id=&quot;ref1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For most of the week, Joe was working from the boat but on the Thursday, he went by train into the office in London. The rest of us moved Liberty Belle from railway station to railway station and let him know where to find us at the end of the day...!
We travelled some of the way with a boat called Lucky No.7, also braving the weather. The boat has a permanent mooring on the river but seems to travel about a lot. The skipper has a friendly dog, who, whenever she got the chance, tried to board our boat.
When we arrived at their home mooring, they turned off and we went through the next lock on our own. As we were waiting in the lock, Lucky No.7's dog suddenly sprang into action, left her boat while the skipper was mooring and hurtled over the bridge, joining a couple taking their dog for a walk. The two dogs were obviously very pleased to see each other. The couple turned back and, returning the dog to her owner, explained to me that the dogs were from the same litter. Apparently, when the sister dog from Lucky No.7 leaves the mooring, the brother dog spends each day staring up the canal in the direction they went. Whenever they return there is a dramatic re-union! How sweet!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Lee Navigation follows the River Lee (or Lea - the jury is still out), and the mooring opportunities are few and far between. Not having a gang plank reduced our options further. As we got closer to Hertford we began to worry that there wouldn't be a space there for us....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Liberty Belle's extra crew members walking the towpath which was suddenly diverted. We didn't see them again until the next lock...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Ware riverside gazebos. Where? Ware...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just before Hertford, we met a CRT engineer who was just moving one of their boats through a lock. He then helped us through too and reassured us that there were a couple of spaces in Hertford, one where his boat had been moored the day before and another recently vacated one, so we should be fine. Sure enough, we did find a lovely mooring alongside some allotments, a short distance from the town and the supermarket. It wasn't very close to Joe's van but was very near to a car park, and he was able to move there before unloading all his gear from Liberty Belle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They left us on the Saturday morning to get to Bursledon just in time for puppy training classes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We explored Hertford and decided that we really like the small town and were happy to leave Liberty Belle moored there whilst we went back to the house for a short visit. This trip home was for a sad occasion. Our dear friend, Trixie, who had been our next-door neighbour for 25 years, had sadly passed away. We went to join her family and friends at her funeral service. So sad. She will be missed by so many people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Where Next?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, when Tony and I discussed our adventures we had, to my relief, decided against taking Liberty Belle onto the tidal section of the Thames, from Limehouse to Teddington. On investigation Tony had discovered that we needed a VHF radio and someone who was trained to use it, so I was relaxed in the knowledge that this wasn't going to happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just before we went back to the house, however, Tony found a VHF training course in Southampton going cheap for last minute bookings. He booked and paid for the course which was scheduled for the day after our arrival. Of course he passed with full marks and managed to borrow a hand-held radio from Helen and Peter. (Thanks guys!) So, that is my fate sealed....&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rachel Glombek</name></author><category term="LibertyBelle" /><summary type="html">From Paddington to Hertford 18th - 25th February 2020 Our route</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">“Welcome to Merchants Square”</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/libertybellenewsletter/libertybelle/2020/03/15/welcome-to-merchants-square.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="&quot;Welcome to Merchants Square&quot;" /><published>2020-03-15T19:27:00+00:00</published><updated>2020-03-15T19:27:00+00:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/libertybellenewsletter/libertybelle/2020/03/15/welcome-to-merchants-square</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/libertybellenewsletter/libertybelle/2020/03/15/welcome-to-merchants-square.html">&lt;h2&gt;Paddington Basin&lt;/h2&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Our route&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n71/IMG_20200211_144247794.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Hi Paddington!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, there we were, fighting Storm Dennis as we approached Paddington Basin. We had booked and paid for our mooring in advance because we had arranged to meet Joe, Kirsty and Carter there in a few days time. We were all looking forward to a bit of sight-seeing there before we explored the River Lee. As it was so windy, it was a relief to know that they were expecting us (or, as our confirmation email had stated, &quot;looking forward to seeing you&quot;), because turning around in the basin and searching for a possibly non-existent mooring space was going to be doubly difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we passed the restaurant boat, 'Darcie Green', permanently moored outside Paddington station, the wind, funnelled between the buildings, became very strong and we only just missed knocking the boat as the diners watched...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(The next boat to come along behind us did bump into poor Darcie and just stayed there overnight, moored against the restaurant!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We carried on, arriving just in front of our pontoon in the Merchants Square area of Paddington Basin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was no space!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now what do we do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We pulled over to the edge of the canal and I held onto the centre rope, whilst Tony went to investigate the pontoon situation. Storm Dennis wasn't keen on Liberty Belle staying where she was but I stood my ground!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst Tony was confirming the lack of mooring space, a security guard approached me and insisted that I move our boat. Tony returned and we both tried to explain that we had booked and payed for a mooring on the pontoon and we were not going to travel past the pontoon, turn and return the way we had come, partly because it was far too windy but mostly because we had already paid to be here!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our explanation did little to stem the flow of his insistence that we move.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tony tied Liberty Belle to the light fittings to save my arm muscles, (which probably didn't go down too well), then went on board to contact the Canal &amp;amp; River Trust as it was far too windy outside for a phone conversation. After the usual confusion, they requested that Tony take a note of the number of each of the 6 boats on the pontoon. This he did. It didn't help much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the security guard's immediate boss, Duke, arrived and showed us a CRT mooring amongst some little hire boats which we could use. He and the original guard helped with Liberty Belle's ropes and we tied up to the temporary mooring, after promising the CRT that we would move onto the official pontoon as soon as a space became available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok. Great. Agreed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Well, agreed, except we were not going to stay on the boat all day waiting for this to happen, we had paid to be here and we were going to make the most of it..!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all shook hands, (probably the last hand-shakes of 2020) and, with smiles all around, Duke said &quot;Welcome to Merchants Square&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n71/P1290707.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;2&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Liberty Belle giving the boats moored at the pontoon a very hard, Paddington stare.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n71/IMG_20200211_143003268_HDR.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;3&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Moored in amongst the hire boats.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;It felt a bit like the naughty step.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So off we went for a walk along the Regents Canal. When we returned the pontoon situation was still the same so we settled down for the night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n71/IMG_20200211_145611927.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;4&quot; /&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Evening in Paddington Basin.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just before our 7 a.m. alarm, we were woken by a knocking noise on the boat which gradually travelled from the front of the boat to the back... What could it be?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the knocking got closer to the back we realised it was accompanied by a voice, asking to speak to the occupant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tony stuck his head out of the hatch above our back door and spoke to the two security guards who insisted that we move the boat. Tony insisted he would not and tried to explain the situation, when he could get a word in...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually Duke arrived and sorted things out. Good grief.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We checked the pontoon situation, which hadn't changed, so off we went for a day in London.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On our return things were still the same so we settled down for the night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Tony trying to get on his high horse in Belgravia.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following morning we got up at our own speed, to find that one of the boats on the pontoon was setting off. Great. We moved Liberty Belle into the space, as promised. Phew.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once we were moored, one of the other boats left too, which was very lucky, because the first boat returned from collecting water to find us in his space....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We kept a low profile and went into London again for more sight-seeing. As it was raining, we decided to spend the day in the Victoria and Albert Museum, one of our favourites, and broke the journey back with a visit to The Victoria, a very smart pub near Paddington.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n71/IMG_20200213_103606021_HDR.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;14&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;This allotment was a surprise!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The rather lovely Victoria pub, a very pleasant place to wait for the rain to stop...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After yet another day in the same place, we were running very low on water, so Tony took our large plastic water containers on several trips to a not-so-nearby tap and topped up Liberty Belle's tank using those. Where was I when all this heavy work was taking place? In the launderette. That's important work too, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So by the time Joe, Kirsty and Carter arrived we were moored where we were supposed to be, all clean and topped up with water. They had driven to Hertford, parked the van and taken the train to Paddington, via Liverpool Street station and the underground. Quite an adventure for a puppy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n71/IMG_20200213_182124414.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;17&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Our mooring at the pontoon, the official mooring that we had actually booked...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Kirsty and Carter keeping each other entertained on the train.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a couple of days together in London (during which Kirsty introduced me to the shopping heaven that is Whole Food Market. Oh my goodness, I haven't lived!), we set off to spend half term travelling along the Lee Navigation (in the rain) to find Joe's van.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Where Next?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are now in Bishops Stortford waiting for Cathy to join us by train tomorrow. Our future plans are still the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good luck to all those who are self-isolating and those abroad who have no choice, as well as those who are waiting to see whether they are wanted at work or not. In fact, good luck to us all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep each other safe and well. xx&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rachel Glombek</name></author><category term="LibertyBelle" /><summary type="html">Paddington Basin 11th - 17th February 2020</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Slow Boat to London</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/libertybellenewsletter/libertybelle/2020/03/13/slow-boat-to-london.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Slow Boat to London" /><published>2020-03-13T17:47:00+00:00</published><updated>2020-03-13T17:47:00+00:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/libertybellenewsletter/libertybelle/2020/03/13/slow-boat-to-london</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/libertybellenewsletter/libertybelle/2020/03/13/slow-boat-to-london.html">&lt;h2&gt;From Uxbridge to Greenford&lt;/h2&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Our route&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Cowley Lock&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were on our way to London along the Grand Onion. Last time we were here we had scooted past the Slough Arm, so this time we turned at the well hidden junction to explore this short, surprisingly rural, branch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;We squeezed through the gap past the boatyard with a boat swinging in the air.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n70/P1290538.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;5&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;This pretty, rural setting is very popular mooring, with the boats doubled up along most of the branch.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last time we were in Brentford, we found a mooring with its own tap, near the shower facilities, and we were hoping to do the same this time, but no luck. We ended up travelling further than we had planned but finally we saw a gap and pulled in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It soon became apparent why the space was available. There seemed to be an obstacle underwater, preventing us from getting parallel with the tow path. I stayed with Liberty Belle and Tony searched for a better mooring but the only space available was for Winter Mooring Permit holders. Oh well, beggars can't be choosers!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Now this sounds sensible.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;So far though, it's just a building site.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the crow flies, Kew gardens was very close to our mooring, so we decided to visit. Unfortunately we were on the wrong side of the Thames, so, being non-crow, we had to walk quite a long way to find a bridge to cross, then walk back along the river to the gardens, Oh well, it was a lovely day!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have both been to Kew Gardens on several occasions but we still managed to discover new treasures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;...so we made the most of it on this visit.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The view from the tree-top walk.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That night Liberty Belle somehow managed to find herself on top of the underwater obstacle. Oddly, just as we were leaving the EU, she suddenly lurched and ended up at a frightening angle, dangling off this hidden ledge! We both woke with a start. Tony leapt into action and went outside to shove at the boat, finally succeeding in getting us floating again. (I remained in the bed, supervising things from there...)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following day Tony went in search of somewhere more suitable to tie up. There was still a space at the Winter Moorings and, strictly speaking, although the permit holders have priority, other boats can moor there if a space is available. Clearly, no one was using this space...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We slid in, hoping that no-one with a permit would move us on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were expecting Joe and Carter to arrive the following day and we were now in a more convenient spot, nearer to the railway station. As it turned out, we also had a surprise visit from Robin and Julie on their way home from a trip to London. What a sociable day!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n70/IMG-20200202-WA0003.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;21&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Oh no!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Is this the end of Maggot...? *&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joe's plan was to work while he was staying with us, by either going into the office (near St. Pauls) or working from the boat.&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;On the first morning Joe went into London for the day and our only tasks were&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;look after the puppy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;collect water.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, 1) was simple, tiring, but simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as 2) was concerned, we decided to wait until a break in the rain before setting off for the tap just before the nearby lock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, a boat passed us, heading in that direction. We were concerned that he would pinch our space on his way back from the tap if we vacated it so we waited....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After quite some time Tony went off to see what had happened to the boat and found it moored at the lock. Ok, that meant we were safe to go!
Before we set off, another boat passed us. Oh, for goodness' sake!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We waited for him to return...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We did, finally, move to the lock, turn, stop at the tap and fill up with water, then return to 'our' mooring, but it took all day! We hoped Joe's day had been more productive...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once we had spent a few days in Brentford we moved on, back through Hanwell, then turned onto the Paddington Arm.  In front of us were 2 very slow boats, so we gradually made our way to Greenford in a frustratingly sedate convoy. There we found a very nice 14 day mooring near a pub...&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The Birds are gathering....&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;We did see a tree full of cormorants. We have never seen that before...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;...but we have no photo of that, so here are some crows.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Turning onto the Paddington Arm...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n70/P1290630.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;27&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;... we've got ourselves a convoy!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst we were moored in Greenford, Joe had another day in town and John &amp;amp; Melissa caught up with us. We decided to make use of the dog friendly pub for our meal. Sadly it was too dog friendly, with dogs wandering about and demanding treats from the besotted barmaid. Carter found this far too distracting and therefore so did we!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once Joe and Carter had headed for home, we decided to stay in Greenford for a while.
We had another day out in London, a day of sitting tight for storm Ciara and a day hunting the Gruffalo in the woods nearby.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, on a sunny morning, we headed for our 7 day pre-booked mooring in Paddington Basin. We had decided to take the stress out of our visit by reserving (and paying for) a mooring through the Canal &amp;amp; River Trust online booking system....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Was it worth booking?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, that's another story...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Where Next?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are currently North of London exploring the Lee Navigation and the River Stort. We will need to return the way we came, back to London, where we will brave the tidal section of the Thames.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we survive that and Liberty Belle is still afloat, we hope to travel down the Basingstoke Canal, followed by the River Wey.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our first task on the morning of 20th was to get Liberty Belle to a tap. Fortunately we had enough water in the kettle for a morning cuppa.... then off we went!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are signs of spring now. Some leaf buds in the hedges, a little blossom here and there as well as some birds, heron and coots in particular, thinking about pairing up and nesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;...probably built by a rich landowner.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We just managed to squeeze Liberty Belle into a space next to a very popular tap!
Whilst waiting for our turn we met&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;a musician who has lived on boats for years, both here and in Spain. He tried living in a house for a while but couldn't do it and went back to a boat. He was waiting for a gap near the tap for his boat and meanwhile was having a cuppa on another boat in the queue.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;a boater who's car engine had become waterlogged. The RAC van arrived at the tap and we all watched the proceedings.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;the owner of a small plastic boat (the shape of which you could just make out underneath all his 'stuff') who was looking for somewhere to empty his toilet. &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After filling our water tank we moved off to the next lock but the small plastic boat had beaten us to it. If it had been a narrowboat we could have shared the lock, but Liberty Belle would probably crush a little boat like that, so we let him go ahead. He started operating the lock with a spanner.....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was too painful to watch so I suggested he get back on board his boat and let me do the work using my windlass. Meanwhile, Tony went to fetch one of our spares and gave it to him. &quot;'ow much do yer want for it?&quot; was his response as he took it. Tony explained that he was welcome to it but has a feeling he has probably sold it since....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having seen the chap through the lock we passed through it ourselves and moored in a space underneath a railway bridge. As we arrived, the boat in front of us was leaving. I hoped it wasn't us he was escaping from but he explained he was leaving because of &quot;all the pigeon shit&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh. I see. Good point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On our travels over the next few days we stopped and investigated Watford, Rickmansworth, the village of Harefield and a couple of Nature Reserves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first was Cassiobury Park, originally the grounds of an abbey, then a manor house. Over the years, as parts of the land came up for sale, they were purchased by the council and became a public park.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second was Stockers Lake Nature Reserve, the site of old gravel pits, now flooded, with wide paths, visitor facilities and lots of water birds to see.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One morning, after passing through a lock, I was just closing the gates, (which were very heavy), when Tony called back to tell me there was a boat coming, so I swung one of the gates back open. Walking along the towpath I realised the oncoming boat had pulled in. On speaking to the owner it was immediately obvious that he had had something rather more interesting for breakfast than I had! He seemed to think it was hilarious that I had left the gate open.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;conversationlisten&quot;&gt;&quot;I get told off for leaving gates open!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;conversationtalk&quot;&gt;&quot;Sorry I thought you were going into the lock..... Are you going into the lock?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;conversationlisten&quot;&gt;&quot;I am Babe, I am going into the lock, I am.&quot; (Much laughter...)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;conversationtalk&quot;&gt;&quot;So, I left it open for you.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;conversationlisten&quot;&gt;&quot;I get told off for leaving gates open!&quot; (Much more laughter...)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;conversationtalk&quot;&gt;&quot;Ok, bye! Have a good day!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I was to find out, it is a local habit to leave the gates and paddles up when you exit the locks around here. So much so, that the Canal &amp;amp; River Trust have put signs on the locks to remind people. So annoying! Maybe if I start adding a little something to my muesli I would find it funnier...&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;It certainly has a fair sized village pond...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;oh, and an internationally renowned heart &amp;amp; lung hospital.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We spent some time looking for the church in Harefield, which turned out to be at the bottom of Church Hill, which we thought was unusual. Attached to the church is a Military Cemetery containing 120 graves of Australian servicemen from the First World War. The Harefield Hospital was originally set up for Australians wounded in Europe and 50,000 of them were cared for there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The unique scroll-shaped headstones were designed by people from the hospital before the War Graves Commission introduced the usual, more simple design.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;I decided not to add our bin to this lot...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Great fun for kayaks but poor Liberty Belle struggled past, just missing a moored boat by inches...&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;I wasn't planning to swim in the canal anyway...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our next planned stop was in Uxbridge. We arrived to find that all the mooring spaces were taken so we had to keep moving. We found a place to tie up outside an industrial estate a little further down the canal. We were still within walking distance of Uxbridge town, so we toured the charity shops to buy some toys for Cocker Spaniel Carter who was due to visit soon. Whilst there we hatched a plan to travel by train into London the following day. At the start of our journey we discovered that we hadn't emptied our rucksack properly after our shopping spree the day before, and had a small stowaway....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To avoid the rush hour crowds and train prices, we decided to find a pub to while away some time. Unfortunately, it was also rush hour in the pubs! Eventually we found one with a couple of spare stools. The two other people seated at the table welcomed us. They were train drivers and RMT representatives who had been at a meeting earlier in the day and were the two most drunk men we had seen in a very long time! We had a short conversation with them which was repeated many times and successfully entertained us for quite a while... When we left them, both Tony and I were hugged and kissed goodbye by them both. They had already been there for about 5 hours and showed no inclination to leave!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;3rd - 19th January 2020&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/maps/n68map.png&quot; alt=&quot;Our route&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Our route&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n68/P1290365.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A pile of hundreds of empty mussel shells crammed into a corner of a lock gate.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Empty mussel shells crammed into a lock gate.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Odd...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, with the festive season behind us, (feeling somewhat heavier and less fit, as is traditional), we journeyed back to Marsworth where we had left Liberty Belle. We try not to worry about abandoning our boat but it is always a relief when we find her exactly where we left her, safe and sound, with nothing missing...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had to walk a couple of miles or so from Tring railway station so we hadn't packed any food from home, and there was no food on board, so we were obliged to eat in the local pub.... Shame!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following morning we travelled through 7 locks and found a mooring on the outskirts of Berkhamsted. Still having no food, we walked into the town, ate in a pub again (what a bad habit), then walked back via Waitrose where we picked up a few bits. We pulled Liberty Belle over at the 2 hour shopping mooring right outside Waitrose as we passed by the next morning and stocked up properly. So far so good!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n68/P1290362.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Cowroast lock. Last time we came the new wood was quite red with black writing on it. This time the timer is a silver grey.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Cowroast Lock.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Last time we were here, these gates were brand new. It is already showing signs of weathering.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n68/P1290363.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A verty rotten lock gate with a orange painted steel brace.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;A little further along the canal, this lock gate must surely be next on the list for replacement!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, out of nowhere, we had our first experience of canal rage! On a wide stretch of canal we saw a boat heading towards us. There was plenty of room but the oncoming boat didn't seem to be taking advantage of the width, heading straight for us. Tony gradually moved more and more to the right, closer and closer to the fishermen lining the towpath. Strangely, the other boat seemed to be hugging the towpath too. Suddenly he started shouting at Tony, demanding that he use his common sense and pass on the other side! One of the fishermen, assuming that boats should stay on the left, as cars do, joined in! Many words were exchanged....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The boats just managed to miss each other and no fishing equipment was damaged but it was quite an episode, albeit a slow motion one! We still don't know what it was all about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We moored in Berkhamsted for several days outside The Rising Sun, known to the locals and boaters as &quot;The Riser&quot;, a pub we came across last time we were here and rather like!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n68/20200106-IMGP0011.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Rachel stood in front of the canalside Rising Sun pub at Berkhamstead&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Outside the pub...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n68/20200108-IMGP0002.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A poster outside the pub reading 'The Rsing Sun. There's nothing for You Here' with characters from the TV series 'League of Gentlemen'&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;...where a warm welcome awaits....??&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n68/IMG_20200105_170040278.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A single flocked decoration on the wall reading 'Christmas at the Rising Sun'&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The full extent of the Christmas decorations in the Rising Sun...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Impressive.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Berkhamsted is a pleasant town with proper shops, an excellent community cafe, some historical interest and plenty of walks in the hills around, so we weren't short of things to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walking around the area we came across a monument to the 3rd Duke of Bridgewater who created the first canals to carry coal from his mines in Worsley. (We visited the wharf there during one of  Mary's visits.) It seems the family seat was the Ashridge Estate, near Berkhamsted. The monument was built quite some time after his death and the widow of his successor, who was resident at the time, insisted that the monument was erected far enough away from the house to prevent her from seeing it because she found it so ugly. I have to sympathise with her....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n68/IMG_20200106_100803632.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A wooden sign with footpath arrows pointing in all directions.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Footpaths every which way.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n68/20200106-IMGP0020.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Rachel stood in a zig zag warren of worn earth trenches.&quot; /&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;We found it but it was, of course, closed...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having explored Berkhamstead we moved to Hemel Hempstead where we stayed for a few days whilst storm Brendan blew itself (himself?) out.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n68/20200112-IMGP0026.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Liberty Belle moored between two other boats on a wide, peaceful bit of canal near a lock.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Our mooring in Hemel Heampstead.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hemel Hempstead has much to admire. It has a wide pedestrianised town centre with a variety of shops and long strip down the middle dedicated to children's play areas and various types of seating, some of which are under cover. On this main street is the entrance to a covered shopping centre which has a soft play area, comfortable seating and toilet facilities with large cubicles for family use, changing facilities with a hoist, large enough for use by an adult, curtained babyfeeding cubicles with comfy armchairs and a small kitchen with microwave. Beat that!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What's more, there is a long strip of garden following the river, which separates the main shopping street from the car parks, which are well hidden from sight as you stroll along the winding path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wouldn't suggest it is somewhere to go out of your way for, but if you are in the area, Hemel Hempstead is worth a look.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Well, well, well!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our wanderings we also found the historic town of Old Hemel Hempstead which still has its own high street with some interesting old buildings as well as a delightful public park and play area.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Near our mooring space was the SunnySide Farm Shop and Cafe where a charity employs adults with learning difficulties to grow and sell produce, look after the hens, and run the cafe. We felt we should support them so we bought a loaf of bread, some expensive, tiny eggs and some extremely expensive washing-up liquid refill. I just hope it's super-concentrated!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One day, in search of a launderette, we walked along the canal to visit Kings Langley. On the way back we stopped at a cafe boat where we had tea and cake whilst listening to the owner's unfavourable opinion of the Canal &amp;amp; River Trust. It seems that they have made it difficult for him to run his business. Shame on them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the weather was more favourable we moved Liberty Belle to Kings Langley.
Joe was hoping to meet up with us so we walked from KIngs Langley to Watford looking out for a suitable mooring space on the way. We needed a parking space near by as well as easy access to a railway station so that Joe could spend the day working in London.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On our walk we came across a boat that was straddling the canal, its back mooring pins having worked their way out of the sodden ground, and the front pins were only just holding too. It was effectively blocking passage for any other boats as well as being in danger of drifting off. Tony contacted the Canal &amp;amp; River Trust to explain the situation and they contacted the owners. That was our good deed for the day done!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We returned from Watford on the train, having concluded that Liberty Belle was already in the best position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following day we had a nose around Kings Langley where we found a church cafe selling excellent cakes and a fish and chip shop! Not a bad day!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joe and his puppy, Carter, joined us that evening and stayed for a couple of nights. During the day Joe went into work by train and we got to play with Carter!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n68/IMG-20200117-WA0014.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Rachel with Carter the cocker spaniel sniffing at the full extent of his lead.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;What's this over here?&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;What's that over there?&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;This way. No, that way.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Backwards, forwards,&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;upwards, downwards,&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;here, there,&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Walking a puppy.....!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Joe and Carter had gone back to their normal lives, we decided to follow in Joe's footsteps and take a train into London for the day. We saw the Wallace Collection, which is well worth a visit, caught up with Robin, walked along the river and took in the views from level 10 in the Tate Modern. It was a pleasant, sunny, satisfying day but tiring. When we got back on the boat we just managed to have a shower each before we completely ran out of water! Oh well, we will have to move tomorrow to find the next tap...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Where Next?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are gradually making our way into London, as slowly as our water supply will allow, hoping that we will find suitable moorings as we go. In the spring we tentatively plan to travel North up the rivers Lee and Stort then, (via the Thames), tackle the River Wey and Basingstoke canal, followed by the Thames to Lechlade.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rachel Glombek</name></author><category term="LibertyBelle" /><summary type="html">From Marsworth to Kings Langley 3rd - 19th January 2020</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">‘Driving Home for Christmas’</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/libertybellenewsletter/libertybelle/2020/01/08/driving-home-for-christmas.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="'Driving Home for Christmas'" /><published>2020-01-08T17:27:00+00:00</published><updated>2020-01-08T17:27:00+00:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/libertybellenewsletter/libertybelle/2020/01/08/driving-home-for-christmas</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/libertybellenewsletter/libertybelle/2020/01/08/driving-home-for-christmas.html">&lt;h2&gt;From Brinklow to Marsworth Junction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3rd - 17th December 2019&lt;/h2&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;...at Hillmorton by Peter Coates in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had been banished to the house for an uncertain amount of time whilst waiting to hear from the boatyard. Liberty Belle's dry dock in Brinklow was actually an old widebeam hull with a lift-up section at the front which can be raised to let water in and allow a narrowboat to be driven inside. Being a boat itself, the dry dock can be floated into position behind the boat that is going to enter it. The front section is then lowered back into place and the water pumped out, allowing access to the narrowboat's hull. Genius.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are baffled by my description of the dry dock and want to know what it is really like, this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TiOyp4xkLfs&quot;&gt;YouTube video of Brinklow's Floating Dry Dock&lt;/a&gt; might help &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To cut a long story short, Liberty Belle didn't have her propeller repaired but instead, had her original propeller, (replaced some time in the past and housed in the engine bay), re-fitted. Her bottom was blacked (in two stages because of unfavourable weather conditions) and a few other little jobs completed that had been recommended when we had her survey done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, on Wednesday 11th December, she was ready to be collected. We drove back in the hire car to a convenient parking space where the road meets the canal, near Brinklow, and walked the muddy route to the boatyard where she was waiting for us. Once on board, we eased our way between all the moored boats to the end of the arm, turned and headed off to the parking space where we loaded the contents of the car into the boat. Tony then drove the hire car into Brinklow, parked and walked back to the boat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n67/20200108-IMGP0010.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Our brass propeller showing a bent blade.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;This is the bent propeller that was removed. The blade on the left shouldn't have a hump in it.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Off we went to Rugby. Initially we weren't very impressed by the propeller, as we seemed to be struggling, but it turned out that we had picked up a large sheet of plastic that was causing the problem. Once that was removed we were off like a shot! With her original propeller in place, Liberty Belle seemed much faster. Apparently, the one that was in place when we bought her was designed to be equally efficient for travelling forwards or in reverse.... As we spend most of our time cruising forwards, hopefully we gain more than we lose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We moored overnight in Rugby and the following morning Tony caught a bus to Brinklow, collected the hire car and returned it to Enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; We then set off for Hillmorton locks, where one of the pounds was short of water, which slowed us down a bit whilst we topped it up. 
The following morning we arrived outside the chandlers in Braunston just as they were opening and bought ourselves 12 bags of coal. (They store their coal indoors here, so it stays dry. Last year we had a lot of wet coal which doesn't create much heat....you live and learn.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we made our way through Braunston we were greeted by a very friendly lady who had heard about us from our newsletter friends, Lin and Charles. It was exciting to be recognised, we felt like celebrities! We didn't have time to stop though, because we had promised ourselves a curry in Weedon Bec if we got there early enough....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, through Braunston Locks and Tunnel, to Norton Junction. Through 7 locks there, (including the one we nearly sank in, right back at the beginning), which were heavy and difficult, partly due to an excess of water.  Then, finally, we arrived! Not only were we in time for a meal out, but we were able to go for a leisurely drink beforehand too. It was our third visit to this particular Indian Restaurant - we are practically regulars!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n67/P1290266.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Bags of coal piled up in the bow and covered with a nylon waterproof cover.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Doesn't everyone keep their coal under a bike cover?&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n67/P1290274.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A view back from the stern of Liberty Belle from inside a lock.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;It feels good to be travelling again.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n67/20191212-IMGP0002.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Tony steering well wrapped up in a waterproof jackest and German army issue arctic mittens.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Wall to wall *&amp;amp;%$£@ geese! The photo doesn't do justice to the numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following day was very windy but we soldiered on regardless, which was a mistake. At one of the locks Tony brought Liberty Belle into the side and held onto her centre rope as it was too windy to just drift about waiting for me to open the gate. There was a sudden gust of wind which took him by surprise and he fell backwards, giving himself a large bump on the back of his head. I was rather worried, thinking he might suddenly collapse later in the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it turned out, we were joined by another boat, so he was kept chatting by the helmsman (or rather, woman), so at least she would notice if something was wrong. Her partner, working the locks with me, was also quite chatty, so we were both entertained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The young couple had met doing the Argentine Tango, which takes them all over the world (I guess they don't tango all the way there and back...). They decided to give up their rented flat in London and buy a boat to live on instead. They work from home and only need to be in London occasionally so it suits them well. They were very up-beat, happy and pleasant people. Their boat is called 'So Long'; see what they did there?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We finished the day by eating leftover curry. It was just as yummy as it had been the day before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tony didn't suffer any ill effects from his accident and the egg-sized lump gradually went away over the next couple of days. Another lesson learnt (possibly) - tie your boat securely when waiting for a lock...&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The weather slowly cheered up over the next two days and we had several sightings of deer and kingfishers. We passed through Milton Keynes without stopping, as we wanted to get a little nearer to Berkhamsted where the canal was due to close for repairs on 7th January. We didn't want to be under too much pressure immediately after Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Marsworth we found an ideal mooring; amongst other boats, outside a private house with plenty of people passing backwards and forwards. We decided that Liberty Belle would be safe there for the two weeks over Christmas. It did mean we had over 2 miles to walk along the muddy towpath to get to the railway station the following morning, but we travelled light and got there in plenty of time to catch our train to Eastleigh. (Chandlers Ford station was closed because of rail strikes...)&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;*Apparently there is some doubt about the name of the Cosgrove bridge.
In Feb 1996 the Parish Clerk tries to cover his arse in a local newsletter....&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The image reads...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;ORNAMENTAL BRIDGE - BRIDGE ROAD: As neither British Waterways, Village historians nor Older residents can agree, i.e., Solomons or Samsons Bridge. (British Waterways, know it as Solomons Bridge but can't confirm the origin of that name). The clerk to avoid embarassment and, in an attempt to remain neutral as a non resident, intends to refer to it by the above title from now on. As you read this, it is hoped that work has already commenced on the bridge and its approaches as previously reported.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Where Next?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are currently moored in Berkhamsted and have been exploring the local area. As yet we haven't done any planning at all! We will let you know when we have.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Our route&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&quot;Birmingham has more canals than Venice, but I know where I'd rather be...&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A quote from a friend. (You know who you are!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We, in contrast, were very enthusiastic about the adventure ahead of us as we set off from Cambrian Wharf, looking forward to the twists and turns, loops and junctions of the Birmingham Navigations. We had read that, although not known for their beauty, these canals were interesting from an industrial point of view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It all started well, round the Port Loop, the Soho Loop, up the pretty Smethwick Locks and across the beautiful Aqueduct onto the Engine arm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n66/P1280553.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Such pretty iron footbridges.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n66/P1280466.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;2&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Smart new housing on the Port Loop.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;A little canine gongoozler.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our first tiny hiccup was having to be towed around the turning space at the end by a kind gentleman whose boat is moored there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst we stood on the stern watching him haul us around, we chatted about the large old warehouse opposite his boat. Apparently it is a listed building which has been strengthened inside to preserve it. The outside remains untouched, including a protruding wooden structure. The man said it would inevitably fall at some point and he just hoped it missed his boat when it did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanking our helper, we moved back across the aqueduct and then through the delightful Galton Valley, which makes you feel, (briefly), like you are in the middle of the countryside. This illusion is almost immediately shattered by the main roads criss-crossing overhead... Down below, The Old Main Line passes over the New Main Line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our next diversion was along the Titford Arm, up the Oldbury Locks to The Pumphouse. We planned to turn at the next winding hole but we didn't quite get that far. The canal proved to be too shallow for us, so we had to reverse the half mile back to the Pumphouse.  Well done, Tony, that was not an easy task!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A resident boater at the Pumphouse stood, with mug of tea in hand, and watched us backing up. He offered us a mooring for the night, for which we thanked him, but we insisted on returning down the lock flight, so he recommended some safe moorings. What a nice man.
We moored up at a pontoon that he mentioned. It is safe because you can't reach it on foot. It was sooo slippery that we couldn't have walked off if we tried!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple of days later we met a boater who had injured his knee in this very place. Ouch.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Travelling backwards....&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We then continued to twist our way around the network, moving from the Old Main Line, (the wiggly one), along the connecting Gower Branch onto the New Main Line, (the straight one), until we found our way onto the Walsall Canal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we travelled down the Ryders Green Locks which were easy to operate, once we got through the pallets. At the seventh lock we met a friendly group of people gathered around a shopping basket fire with their supply of booze and kindling. They warned us about the hidden obstacles in the canal ahead, advising us to stay strictly in the middle. Thanks to them we made it through to the visitor moorings in Walsall without incident, but it was slow going.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;We stopped counting them after a dozen.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Something with 4 wheels...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walsall was bigger than I was expecting and looked interesting, so we decided to spend a day exploring. Some of our time was lost searching for the Museum. We tried following the tourist signs, some of which had been moved (people seem to enjoy this game). Finally we arrived at the library and asked an assistant. The museum we were seeking closed 5 years ago but the signs have been left up. Okaaayyyy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turned out that this wasn't the oddest thing about the town. On our travels we discovered St Paul's, which is part church and part shopping centre. It was converted in the 1990's and surely has to be unique.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also came across the 'Retail Multiples' which is an indoor market and Post Office, which is strange but seems to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the outskirts of the town there is the Walsall Arboretum, which is a public garden made on the site of a flooded limestone quarry. Oddly, it isn't an arboretum. At the time, it was fashionable for a town to have an arboretum, so that's what they called their park. This explanation is given, as if it makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We made our way to the visitor's centre where there was a craft sale, (well, that's what they called it), and a display of quilted wall-hangings, representing local villages. They were beautifully made and very slightly bonkers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a bit of sanity we visited the Art Gallery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n66/IMG_20191116_151429745_HDR.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;19&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;St Paul's still looks like a church from the outside&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n66/IMG_20191116_151446981.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;20&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;From the inside it looks like a shopping mall.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n66/IMG_20191116_152218545.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;21&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;It turns out that it is both.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n66/IMG_20191116_152053193.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;22&quot; /&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;This face pops up a lot around here.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;In this case he has been stitched onto a wall-hanging.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, after the un-reality check that is Walsall, we left our moorings and turned a corner straight into the Walsall flight of 8 locks. There was so little water that I had to go to the top lock to send enough down to keep Liberty Belle floating. It was a long job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the 7th lock, Liberty Belle got stuck half way in. Tony couldn't persuade her to go forwards or backwards. I tried flushing water at her but it didn't help. Meanwhile, the Wolverhampton Community Payback Team came to see what was going on. They were full of advice and tried to pull us out using the stern rope. This didn't work, so Tony rang the CRT for help and, whilst we were waiting for someone to ring him back, it was noticed that the boat had shifted slightly. Tony tried to reverse and she moved! A huge log bobbed up at the bow. It must have been wedged underneath between the entrance to the lock and Liberty Belle's bow. One of the team persuaded us to let him use our barge pole to try and move the log. He was successful and we were able to continue. Well done lads!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tony phoned the CRT to cancel our rescue. Finally we got through the last lock, arriving to the sound of loud singing and the sight of a parade with people of all ages waving flags and led by white horses!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turned out it wasn't for us, but a celebration of the Prophet Mohammed's birthday. I waved madly and a couple of people encouraged me to join in and come for the feast, but I thought of Tony waiting on the boat, and decided to decline!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We carried onto the Wyrley and Essington Canal. Nicknamed the Curley Wyrley it has some very tight corners under its bridges and is annoyingly shallow, but it has some pretty sections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n66/P1280738.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;25&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Phew. Made it to the top of the Walsall Locks.
What a morning!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;A stretch of the Wyrley &amp;amp; Essington with pretty views and no rubbish.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n66/P1280754.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;28&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;We tied up to these convenient posts. &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We bypassed the Cannock Extension on this occasion and, turning at Catshill Junction, we went down the Daw End Canal. This leads into the Rushall Canal which was closed due to lock repairs, so we went as far as we could and turned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a night spent at a marina's visitor moorings we returned to the Catshill Junction which was frozen! This was a surprise and made turning the corner onto the Anglesey Branch very difficult, especially as a wheelie bin was frozen into the centre of the canal. We aborted our first attempt and Tony pulled Liberty Belle out of the ice by her stern rope. We started again, breaking up the ice with the boathook as we went so that Liberty Belle could swing round. It was slow and I was all for giving up but we managed and, as it turned out, the canal was very pretty and well worth a look.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the Anglesey Branch was the Chasewater Park, where we had a lunch stop before heading back to Catshill Junction to re-join the Curley Wyrley. The wheelie bin was still there but the ice had melted, thankfully!&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time we went up the Cannock Extension which is as straight as an arrow, heading purposefully nowhere.  It was, however, very pretty in its autumn colours. We didn't go right to the end, but turned at some private moorings in an old colliery arm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So back on the Curley Wyrley, we got as far as Sneyd Junction where we were welcomed onto a mooring outside the facilities by a kind boater on long-term moorings there.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Just throw the old bed in the canal. It'll be fine.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;There's a gap in the fence, very convenient for disposing of stuff you no longer want...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next little branch on our list was the Bradley Arm, (aka Wednesbury Oak Loop), which can be navigated all the way to the end during office hours. Otherwise, there is a winding hole part way along. This seemed so odd that we decided to play it safe and just went as far as the turning point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We decided that it should be easy going because the CRT's workshop is at the end, so they are bound to keep the canal clear. Famous last words!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The canal was very hard work. By the time we had given it the benefit of the doubt, it seemed a very long way to reverse back to the junction, so we soldiered on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We met a boat coming the other way, which was a complete shock as we hadn't seen a moving boat for ages! The helmsman warned us that it had taken him ages to turn at the winding hole. Great. With a boathook and lots of chugging backwards and forwards, we finally managed it.
Just as we were finally facing the right way, a gentleman on the towpath said there was an easier winding hole a few yards further along the canal. Oh well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually we arrived back on the Old Main Line canal, where we could travel at a reasonable speed - possibly even 3 miles an hour!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We made our way to the Black Country Museum visitor moorings and, because of the bad weather, we stayed for a couple of days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The Black Country Museum Visitor moorings.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst moored outside the museum, we went on a boat trip through the tunnels (a bit of a busman's holiday), where we tried 'legging' the boat. This is how boats used to travel through the tunnel. The horses were taken over the top and two or more men lay head to head along wooden boards placed across the boat, with their feet on the tunnel walls. They then walked along the tunnel walls to propel the boat forwards. Once we got going it was surprisingly easy. Of course we didn't have to do it for long...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On our second day we went into the Black Country Museum which is fascinating. We spent quite a lot of time chatting to the various 'historical characters' positioned around the museum in shops and houses. They were very chatty and full of interesting information. Mary is from this neck of the woods, with chain and anchor making being part of her history, so I found it all the more interesting for that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Is 11:30 too early?&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After our couple of days off we were anxious to make up a bit of time. So, via Tipton Green and Pudding Green junctions, we turned onto the Wednesbury Old Canal and back down the Ryders Green locks. Here we met a man who was walking his dog along the towpath. I told him that we had found all the people around here, in the Birmingham area, very friendly. That was a mistake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&quot;You're not in Birmingham now, Bab. This is the Black Country. Never call the Black Country Birmingham, we don't allow that.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think he forgave me though, because he opened a couple of lock gates for us. At lock 7 we were recognised by the group of drinkers gathered around their shopping basket fire, who welcomed us like old friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally we reached the Tame Valley Canal which is remarkably straight, with several aqueducts, but was disappointingly shallow. We slowly made our way to Perry Barr locks, hoping to get through at least some of them before mooring for the night. However, on inspection, it was obvious that the pounds were very low on water and a lot of time would be needed to fill them up. Liberty Belle was already positioned in a nice visitor mooring at the top, outside some boaters facilities, so we decided to tie up, stay put and tackle the locks early the following morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Immediately after breakfast I got into my wet weather gear and set off to start sending water down the locks. I was met by the wonderful sight of a Canal &amp;amp; River Trust employee already on the case! This very nice man not only helped us to work the locks but dashed backwards and forwards to the locks behind and in front of us, re-setting the paddles to allow water to pass down and filling each lock ready for us. He did all this in a cheerful way, chatting to us as he went. This was the first of several flights of locks he had to check that day. Apparently he had never been called a hero before!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During our chats, we discussed the rubbish we had seen in the local canals. He told us that 5 years ago the contract for cleaning the canals went to a company who do not possess a single boat. (As far as we know, Chris Grayling had nothing to do with the contract, on this occasion). As a consequence, they have only been able to remove rubbish from the edges. So now, there is 5 years worth of dumped rubbish waiting to be collected.... Good grief. You couldn't make it up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We reached Spaghetti Junction, which is far more amazing from underneath. The splash from the lorries going through deep puddles is more impressive too when it slops over the side of the road and comes down into the canal in a waterfall... All the fun of a very slow log flume ride!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We joined the Birmingham and Fazeley Canal at Salford junction and moored at the top of the Minworth Lock Flight.. We were cold, wet and hungry, and grateful for some dry clothes, a coal fire and a hot lunch.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Works as hard as a cat?&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;What? &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n66/P1290070.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;62&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Look out for lorry-spray!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Star City. The site of recent violence.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple of days later we turned right onto the Coventry Canal at Fazeley Junction, which proved to be a lot easier than coming the other way. Now on the pretty section of the Coventry Canal we suddenly realised that the locks didn't need anti-vandal keys to operate them, the safety equipment was still in place and we had flower beds rather than rubbish bags to look at. On reflection, we were glad to be free of the Birmingham Navigations. We shan't need to go back there again!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also began to see other boats moving around. One very small boat with an outboard motor seemed anxious to overtake us. Apparently they were in a rush to get to London. We happily moved over so that they could pass. Their motor was thrashing away, creating an impressive wake but not really going much faster than we were, so we stared at their rear-end until we stopped in the delightful Polesworth for a late lunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following day we came across several locks which had been abandoned by the previous occupants with gates open and paddles up, which is very annoying. It seems the little boat in a hurry to get to London had saved themselves time and effort by leaving half their work for me to do! Charming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We braved frozen ropes, slippery surfaces and mooring pins frozen into the ground to get to the useful little town of Nuneaton. It’s main claim to fame seems to be George Eliot, who gets a mention at every turn.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;George Eliot, in drag...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next we joined the Oxford Canal at Hawkesbury junction and on to Brinklow where we moored just around the corner from the boatyard where Liberty Belle had an appointment with a dry dock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following morning, as we were trying to turn through the iced-over canal, we had a phone call from the engineer to check that we were on our way, reassuring us that, once we had passed under the railway bridge, he would see us and sort us out. Did he heck. He was having his tea break whilst we wondered where to go, what to do and where everyone was! Eventually Liberty Belle was settled into the dry dock and we were on the bus to Rugby, where we picked up our hire car and set off for the house.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Are we in the right boatyard?&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Where Next?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope you are all having a delightful festive season! We are at the house at the moment, enjoying the company of family and friends. We will be heading back to Liberty Belle in the New Year to move her on past some locks in Berkhamstead which will close from 7th January until the end of March. We will potter about in the area until the Spring, when we can set off again to explore the parts of the network that we missed out this year.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rachel Glombek</name></author><category term="LibertyBelle" /><summary type="html">From Birmingham to Brinklow 13th November - 2nd December 2019</summary></entry></feed>
