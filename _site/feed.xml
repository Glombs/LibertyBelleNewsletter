&lt;h2&gt;22nd August - 3rd September 2020&lt;/h2&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Liberty Belle as seen from Fotheringhay Castle.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We set off from Peterborough in some very strong winds making it difficult to steer. Travelling up the River Nene, boats enter the locks under the guillotine style gates which are left open, so getting into the locks was relatively simple. However, once Liberty Belle was out of the other end, Tony had to control her in the strong winds, pulling over to the lock landing, waiting to collect me whilst I stayed behind to empty the lock and re-lift the guillotine gate. Then he had to somehow steer her away from the lock landing in order to set off again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On one occasion I wasn't strong enough to pull the gates shut behind us so I had to abandon them. On another, there was a boat moored at the lock landing leaving no room for Liberty Belle to pull over to collect me after exiting the lock, so I had to get on before we left the lock with the gates still open. By the time we got to Fotheringhay Castle we were rather tired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;...and mills to admire as we pass by.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Not only Richard III's birth place but also Mary Queen of Scots' death place and Liberty Belle's mooring space.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following morning the wind had dropped and life should have been easier, except someone left the windlass at one of the locks. We didn't realise this until we arrived at the next one, some time later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tony thought the footpath along the river might be accessible from the lock and one of us could walk back to fetch it, however, that turned out not to be so... We couldn't turn around where we were, so, using a spare windlass, we travelled through the lock to turn on the other side where there was more space, immediately re-entering the lock and travelling back the way we had come. Arriving at the previous lock, I picked up the windlass and we turned again. Thank goodness the weather was on our side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, back along the same stretch of river for the third time that morning; back past all the swimmers, kayakers and walkers that had noticed we were rather familiar. We explained ourselves several times...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n86/20200823-P1330907.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;8&quot; /&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Before our Middle Levels experience, we would have thought this bridge was low.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually we arrived outside the pub in Wadenhoe. Tony decided that, although black clouds had gathered, it wasn't going to rain, and off he went to the bar. I was a little behind him and by the time I was ready to join him the rain was coming down in sheets. I took our large umbrella with me but the rain seemed to bypass that and attack me from all sides and from underneath. I was soaked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sloshed my way into the bar which was surprisingly busy, so we stood waiting for the rain to subside a bit before going into the garden. We positioned two chairs together under the umbrella, wiped the seats down and settled in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the recommendation of the landlord, we later went to look around the tiny but fascinating village before settling down for the night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n86/20200823-P1020997.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;14&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Wadenhoe's fabulous dovecote where pigeons were bred for shooting.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn1&quot; id=&quot;ref1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n86/20200823-P1030005.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;15&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Inside the dovecote there is a swinging ladder that gives access to each of the 650 nesting boxes.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Off again. Surely today will be trouble free. Well, not entirely. At one of the locks the electrically operated guillotine gate was out of order and needed to be operated manually. In these situations a large wheel is provided with some mechanism for stopping it from unwinding on its own. In this case it was a chain which is padlocked to a ring welded onto the wheel. The padlock is opened using a key provided for such things. In this particular case we could open the padlock and close it again but could not remove our key afterwards. As the key would be needed many times again over the next few days, this was a problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We managed to wedge the windlass into the mechanism to hold the wheel temporarily and Tony contacted the River Agency who suggested we do our best. I was worried that we would break the key in the lock. Eventually I managed to remove it but this left the padlock in the locked position, not attached to the wheel. This meant the guillotine couldn't be locked in the raised position, as it should be. After much struggling and some WD40 we finally had a lifted gate, a secured wheel and a separate key.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n86/20200824-P1030031.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;16&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The windlass jamming the wheel.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;(Note the broken electric motor flung on the ground beneath)&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These were all small complications and certainly didn't prevent us from appreciating our surroundings and the wildlife around us. We saw plenty of kingfishers darting around which are always delight. One of the several cormorants we saw was in the river ahead of Liberty Belle, wrestling with a very large fish which it finally subdued and swallowed before it noticed us bearing down on him and flew off. We also spotted some goosanders, which are a rare treat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On reaching Irthlingborough we found a mooring opposite a nature reserve and were delighted to discover that it was home to several Great Egrets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;I tried to photograph the cormorant with his fish.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The fish is inside the cormorant.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n86/20200824-P1330936cropped.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;20&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;One of the egrets.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We stayed moored in Irthlingborough to sit out storm Francis' strong winds, which made it difficult to stand upright, let alone steer a boat. Another narrow boat was moored nearby and the two skippers discussed their plans for the next few days whilst observing the rising water levels. (11 inches and counting...)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following our neighbours' example we went to the local nature reserve, 'Stanwick Lakes', for a take away coffee. We arrived just in time before they closed up due to the strong winds. Being careful not to have the cups blown out of our hands and certainly not daring to take the lids off, we sat down at picnic tables near each other and sipped our drinks through the tiny little holes in the lids.....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both boats were heading to Norton, so we hatched a plan to travel together to make life easier at the locks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later, back at the boat, Tony and I were unaware that our bow rope was slipping free. Our neighbour, Jim, left the safety of his boat and came to rescue us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus began the Liberty Belle and Barney partnership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;I'm not sure that this chap was the artist's first choice of model.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n86/IMG_20200825_153522085.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;25&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Stanwick Lakes has some special residents...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n86/IMG_20200825_154120376_HDR.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;26&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;...and all kinds of sculptures.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, the following day, storm Francis having blown himself out, we set off in convoy, sharing the work all the way to Norton.
We moored overnight together at Hardwater Mill and then Becket's Park in Northampton (where we stayed for a day because the weather forecast wasn't good). We continued our partnership the following day but temporarily lost Barney just before we moored up for the night at Weedon Bec (where we snuck out for a curry, which seems to have become a tradition of ours).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;A now isolated arm of the canal at Weedon Bec went to the Royal Ordnance Depot which supplied arms to the Napoleonic Wars and was decommissioned in 1984.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n86/20200830-P1030093.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;32&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;One of the many fabulous buildings at the depot is now a micro brewery...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;History AND beer!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We rejoined forces with Barney in the morning for the last leg into Norton Junction, where we moored up and went with Jim and Margaret to the nearby pub for a pint or two to say our goodbyes. It was sad to break up the 'dream team' but we now had to go our separate ways; Barney to his marina and Liberty Belle to Braunston, where she had an appointment with a man who was going to replace her domestic batteries. (We had been warned when we bought Liberty Belle that her batteries were rather tired but we had soldiered on until now.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n86/20200831-P1330985.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;33&quot; /&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Braunston's converted windmill&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst in Braunston we helped the local economy by having second breakfast at the Gongoozlers' Cafe two days in a row, buying several plumbing bits from the chandlers, (see the radiator story from the last newsletter), and filling the fridge full of Braunston Bangers. In between all the eating, Tony re-tiled the fireplace, again. (It has become an annual event).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Day 2.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Bye bye Braunston.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once our new domestic batteries had been fitted, we set off for Coventry, via Rugby. The weather was rather wet but not unpleasantly so and we arrived to find the ideal mooring in Coventry Basin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;We went to look at the back of the Weavers houses.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Originally built by a Quaker to enable individual weavers to compete with factory workers.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our plan was to collect a hire car, load it up with our washing, and leave Liberty Belle for a few days whilst we popped back to the house and collected Mary for a cruising holiday with us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Footnotes:-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;fn1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the Medieval era Dovecotes were owned by manor houses or monasteries. Over the centuries other more lowly people were allowed to have them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pigeons were free to leave through vents in the roof. Nothing was wasted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The feathers were used to stuff bedding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The droppings were used not just as fertiliser and saltpetre for gunpowder but also to treat baldness, gout and tumours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each pair of pigeons produced 2 offspring 8-10 times a year for 7 years. The chicks, or squabs, were collected when a few weeks old and roasted on spits, pickled, fried, stewed, braised, used in pies, dumplings, fritters and 'pigeon in a hole'. They were not only versatile and nutritious but also prevented plaque and other diseases (?).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can imagine, this appeals to Tony and he has threatened to build one in the garden as soon as we return to the house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;16th - 21st August 2020&lt;/h2&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Our route&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;A change in the weather.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After completing the River Great Ouse and her tributaries we were ready to re-cross the tidal section and return to the Middle Levels to do a bit more exploring. We were booked through the Denver Lock at 5pm, when the tide would be just right for us to scoot the short distance across to Salters Lode Lock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we left Ely and headed towards the lock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n85/20200816-P1330554cropped.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;2&quot; /&gt;

 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n85/20200816-P1330567cropped.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;5&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;A heron leads the way.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We arrived at the lock in plenty of time. Another boat was moored at the landing stage, obviously going through at the same time as us, so we hung about nearby. The sky became darker and darker, the rain began and we could hear thunder in the distance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n85/20200816-P1330605.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;6&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n85/20200816-P1330606.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;7&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Denver Lock under a black sky.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just after our allotted time the other boat was called into the lock and we were ushered in alongside. It was explained to us that when the tide was just right, the other boat would be told to leave; we should give them a 5 minute head start and he would signal for us to go. When we arrived at the other lock it would be fully open and both boats should just glide straight through. It would be a tight turn but we should give it a wide arc. All was calmness and smiles, despite the rain. Golly there was a lot of rain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lock gates opened and the first boat led the way. Suddenly we were ushered out too; that wasn't 5 minutes! As we entered the open river the thunderstorm suddenly raged above us. The rain came down so hard we could barely see where the river went!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We could however, see that the other boat had cut the corner into the other lock rather too much and was aground across the entrance. There was some shouting and the boat rocked and fidgeted, finally coming free and a second attempt to enter the lock was made but again, she was aground. She came free in reverse, shot forwards and disappeared. Was she through? Was it safe to turn into the mouth of the lock ourselves? We would just have to hope that we didn't smack into the back of her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here goes! The lock keeper appeared and encouraged us forward. We gave it our best shot, thankfully missing the wooden barrier on the left and avoiding the shallow patch on the right, we glanced off the wall (suitably lined with old car tyres) and were faced with a closed lock gate! The whole process had taken so long that the lock was no longer open. Gradually the gate was lifted and we made our way in. We were soaked but with so much adrenaline flowing we barely noticed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lock keeper was also dripping wet but that didn't stop him from being cheerful and welcoming, suggesting that we spend the night on his lock landing. We were very grateful for the suggestion and, with much relief, moored up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n85/IMG_20200817_084619_518.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;8&quot; /&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Waking up outside Denver Lock...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;...where the resident kingfisher

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plan for the next day was to travel the Middle Level drains to the town of Ramsey, where we hoped to find suitable moorings and have a little look around. The day started well with good weather and some kingfishers to cheer us on our way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n85/20200817-P1330614.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;10&quot; /&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;&quot;UP TO DATE COTTAGE - 1901&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;If you say so...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We passed back through Marmont Priory Lock, where the lock keeper and her granddaughter spotted us and came out to make sure all was was well. (When we booked passage through in the other direction and had to help two hire boats through, she was nowhere to be seen until all the fuss was over...)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We turned onto Popham's Eau, new 'ground' for us and then turned again onto the functionally named Sixteen Foot Drain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n85/20200817-P1330665.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;12&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;A meeting of two drains.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n85/20200817-P1330676.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;13&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;In the stormy light the duck weed looks stunning.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once on the Middle Levels we discovered the bridges were a bit lower than we had expected or the water level was a bit higher. Whichever it was, the result was the same. We squeezed under the first bridge and the next one looked similar. However, it turned out to be rather saggy in the middle and Liberty Belle caught her solar panel brackets. The noise was horrible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n85/20200817-P1330678.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;14&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Tony thought this was the lowest bridge, but he was soon to find a lower one...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n85/IMG_20200817_164410342_HDRcropped.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;15&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;...that caused the damage to the solar panel brackets.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once we were free of the bridge, we turned onto the Forty Foot Drain. Very slowly we attempted another low bridge but this time we had to admit defeat. Thankfully there was enough room to turn around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were very lucky indeed to find a mooring spot. It was almost miraculous. There had certainly been no others on the way. Despite there being no signs to deter us, we were sure it must be a private mooring, so I clambered up the steep bank to see if we could get permission to stay until the morning. There were two houses across the road opposite the mooring. I managed to find some people in the yard at the back of one and they said it didn't belong to anyone as far as they knew and we were as welcome as anyone to use it. Wow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After some thought we decided that, although the height of the water seemed to be dropping, there was no guarantee that it wouldn't rise again. If we did continue to Ramsey, there is no knowing when we would be able to leave! We agreed to play it safe and return the way we had come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; So, we set off again first thing in the morning, a little disappointed that we hadn't reached Ramsey but relieved that we had made the decision not to tempt fate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So back we travelled through March and Whittlesey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n85/20200818-P1330736cropped.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;16&quot; /&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Back in March&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;(the town, not the month...)&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n85/IMG_20200818_171239732cropped.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;18&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The ceiling beams in the Ship Inn are beautifully carved.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The story is that they &quot;fell off a back of a barge&quot; during the building of Ely Cathedral!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n85/20200819-P1330750.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;19&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The canal through March was full of dead fish.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Liberty Belle's fishing consultant, Aub, says they may have died from lack of oxygen in the water due to the excessive heat.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then on to Stanground Lock, which we had booked ahead. This time through, the lock keeper asked for our centre rope which she tied up at a bollard. She then asked Tony to run the engine in gear to keep the rope taut. We remarked how unusual this request was, as we are usually asked to switch the engine off. She said there was an undercurrent in the lock and it had always been done this way since her grandfather's time as lock keeper. How wonderful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n85/20200820-P1330810.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;20&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Keep that rope tight.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suddenly we were back in Peterborough where we found the perfect mooring next to the car park. You may well wonder why we wanted that particular spot....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, as you ask, it was an important part of the Great Radiator Replacement Adventure, which went a bit like this...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;One leaking radiator. Oh heck.&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;(.......time lapse ......)&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;A second leaking radiator.&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;Much measuring and searching online for suitable radiators in stock somewhere we will be arriving at soon....&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;The decision to purchase 3, as the third leaking radiator was only a matter of time.&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;The worry about carrying 3 radiators from wherever the shop is to wherever we are moored...&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;The decision to order them in Peterborough and to hire a car to transport them&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;The draining and removal of the old radiators and discovery of a long term small leak....&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;Tony's oft repeated refrain - &quot;I hate plumbing&quot;&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;The search for a radiator tool, purchased and found to be the wrong size&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;the attempt to alter the tool so that it would fit....&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;the long search for a plumbing shop that sells the correct tool (the imperial version)&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;the finding of the correct tool in B&amp;amp;Q&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;the inability to take the old radiators to the dump due to not being a resident of Peterborough, so taking them to a scrap metal firm instead&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;the fitting of the new radiators&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;the unsuccessful search in Tony's on-board plumbing supplies for the particular washer to repair the long term leak&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;the purchase of some suitable washers online, sent to our house to be collected later&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;the purchase of some radiator joints containing the suitable washers from some bloke on ebay, also sent to the house&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;the decision to try really hard to get the washers now, before going home, so that the radiators will be ready for Mary's arrival in early September.&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;the social distance queuing at the chandlers to try to buy a plumbing joint containing a suitable washer - twice. Both purchases proving to be the wrong type.&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;giving up and moving onto the servicing of the engine, only to find suitable washers for the radiators in the box of engine bits...&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;the re-filling of the radiators, with the incorrect mix of water and anti-freeze&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;the draining of the radiators&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;the re-filling with the correct mix&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What a palaver!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, we now have 3 brand new radiators that work and don't leak....! *&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Not to mention the National Collection of washers for these particular plumbing joints.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&quot;I hate pumbing.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Notes:-&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Latest update - the radiators are mostly not leaking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ancient town of Ely was built on a clay island, the highest land in the Fens, which was surrounded by marsh land until the drains were built. The clay was quarried and the marshes provided the settlement with peat, willow, rushes and eels. The Abbey there became very wealthy and their glorious cathedral reflects this.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;So impressive.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a quick look around this fascinating city, we decided that the outside of the cathedral was so grand that we wanted to look inside, so Tony booked some tickets for the following morning. We were so pleased we did. Despite the covid masks and one way system, we found Ely Cathedral awesome. If you like a dramatic cathedral, visit Ely. We took photos but they don't do it justice.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Maybe they should have had an eel.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We dragged ourselves away from Ely, continuing along the Great Ouse before turning onto the River Cam, another of its tributaries, and onto the Cambridgeshire Lodes. The Lodes are ancient, navigable drains that branch off the River Cam like the fingers of a clawed hand. They were built by the Romans and, despite various alterations over the centuries, remain essentially the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The modern gateway to the Lodes is through Upware Lock, which is unusual. It has a guillotine gate at both ends but even more interesting is that it automatically resets itself 15 minutes after it's last use. Just beyond the lock is a water tap, so we were able to fill up our tank and witness the resetting. Fascinating!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Enough said.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our exploration of this area began along Reach Lode from which we branched off onto Wicken Lode, around a very tight bend. This was very narrow and absolutely beautiful. The surrounding land, Wicken Fen, is owned by the National Trust and, although the waterway itself is very quiet, the pathway alongside is well used by walkers and cyclists. We turned and slipped into a mooring then went to explore the village of Wicken, which had lots of visitors on this hot, sunny day, particularly in the gardens of the tea room and sitting at the tables on the village green outside the Maid's Head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we got back to Liberty Belle, there was a second narrow boat moored next to her. So maybe the waterway is more popular than we thought....let's hope we don't meet anyone on the way back to the junction....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems that simply hoping doesn't always work. We met a little steam launch head-on. They managed to squeeze themselves against the bank and somehow we got past each other without incident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n84/20200805-P1330125.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;26&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The little steam launch after our successful passing.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On we went to the junction where we attempted to turn onto Burwell Lode. It was very tight and we managed to get wedged across the waterway, effectively blocking the junction. Right behind us was the little steam launch. We apologised over our shoulders as we tried to free poor Liberty Belle; Tony with the Barge Pole and me in charge of pushing against the side of the bridge and driving. After a certain amount of time, which was just long enough to be embarrassing in front of the other boat, we freed ourselves and the steam launch shot off to the right as we went left. Wise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n84/20200805-P1330152.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;27&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The little steam launch escaping from us for the second time in one day.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of Burwell Lode, there was no room left at the moorings so, instead of spending the night there, we returned to Reach Lode and followed it to the end, thankfully finding a mooring in Reach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reach has been inhabited for 2,000 years and in medieval times was a busy port. There is little sign of that now in the sleepy village except for once a year when it holds its annual fair. The fair began in 1210 and has been held every year since except, of course, this year (and possibly during the Black Death). It is held on the large village green which was created by flattening the end of the Devil's Dyke, a 7 mile long Anglo-Saxon earthwork, built for defence but also a trade route, stretching from Reach to Newmarket Racecourse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Returning to the River Cam we headed for Cambridge, stopping at Clayhithe on the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We spent a couple of days in Cambridge. Unfortunately it was far too hot to explore very much so we spent most of our time seeking shade. We were able to meet up with Dave and Fiona under one of the trees near Liberty Belle, which was delightful.  We have decided that we definitely didn't do justice to Cambridge so we will return one day, without Liberty Belle, and give it the attention it deserves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it was time to leave, we turned and travelled back along the Cam to the River Great Ouse, turning south.
At the Stretham Pumping Station we met up with Joe and Kirsty who were on their way home from Norwich. Carter kept popping inside the boat, probably hoping that it was cooler indoors but it most certainly wasn't. Instead they all cooled off in the river before continuing their journey.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;A cooling break in their journey from Norwich.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We continued our journey, too, and arrived at Hermitage Lock which was a bit of a surprise as it was displaying a red traffic light. As Tony pulled over to the lock landing the light turned green so he dropped me off and continued into the lock. I immediately realised I was trapped. There was no exit from the pontoon. There was a piece of laminated A4 paper attached to the fence, bent over in the breeze. It was to inform boat crews that they should stay on their boat as the lock was manned. Oh. I clambered through two sets of railings, under chains strung across both ends of the lock gate bridge, climbed down a ladder covered in weed and dropped onto Liberty Belle's deck. The lock was operated from above and as we left I caught the lock keeper's eye and smirked guiltily. He said I was very agile!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just as we left the lock and were approaching the nearby moorings in Earith, we suddenly saw what we thought was an otter diving under water. As soon as we were tied up we got the binoculars out and scoured the area. It turned out to be a seal! Not as thrilling as an otter but still exciting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n84/20200809-P1330341.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;40&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Have we spotted a shy otter?&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;No, it's a very curious seal.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After our overnight stay in Earith, we continued south to St.Ives which was very pretty, a credit to its namesake in Cornwall. There was just enough room for us to moor after we had nudged a rowing boat out of the way. It had been padlocked in place and there was a notice on it demanding that the owner remove it as it was illegally moored, so we didn't feel too guilty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After lunch and a little look around we moved on to overnight in Huntingdon, stopping briefly on the way to sit out a thunderstorm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leaving Huntingdon we continued our travels and at the approach to a lock we passed a sign telling the upstream traffic to turn right. Confused, we almost missed the sign pointing us to the left for the navigation channel. We jerked Liberty Belle to the left and followed the channel, glimpsing the lock to our right on the way around an island in a circuitous route to the lock entrance. Tony looked it up and saw that we were allowed to go either way, but immediately right would have been quicker and put us in a better position to go straight in. Oh well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following day we stopped at St. Neots for lunch, alongside a park with shady trees... it was so hot that we sat in the shade and stayed for the rest of the day. We are not very good in the heat...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stretch of river on the way into Bedford is absolutely beautiful and there were a lot of people appreciating it on paddle boards and in kayaks, so we took things steadily. It was just as well because there were also scullers zooming about without checking behind them. 
We arrived in Bedford and found some shady trees nearby, thank goodness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the next few days we went back the way we had come, dodging the thunder storms and scullers.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We stopped for the night at St. Neots again, mooring as close to Waitrose as we could in order to re-fill our cupboards. Tony managed to trip up with the help of a short piece of rope and fell to his knees leaving a proper school boy style graze on his knee. That night he had very little sleep because our mooring was also the place of choice for two young men to drink into the night, getting so drunk that Tony was worried about them falling into the river. He kept an eye on them until they had successfully struggled their way up the ramp from the pontoon - apparently it was quite a performance!&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Just Tony's size!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We finally reached Ely again, squeezing ourselves into the last mooring space, which had been vacated moments before we arrived.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ahead of us was the re-crossing of the tidal section of the River Great Ouse, which Tony had booked, and more of the Middle Levels...&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Moored in March.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;(The town of March)&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stanground Lock is the entrance to the Middle Levels, a section of drains between the River Nene and the River Great Ouse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although people have been trying to keep the sea out of this area since the 1400's, Dutch engineers were employed to design and build drains in the 1640's to enable the surrounding land to be used for agriculture and for navigation by 49 foot long commercial boats called Fen Lighters, which would take cargoes across the Fens to and from bigger sea-going vessels. The Middle Level Commissioners, established in 1754, maintain the drains and many have now been altered to allow the passage of longer narrow boats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n83/20200728-P1320312.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;2&quot; /&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Yes, it works!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to the inevitably flat terrain, we had the same view for miles;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;wind turbines, being put to very good use in all the wind;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;a huddle of trees dominated by poplars, with a house nestled behind them;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;a pumping station in a low brick building with nest boxes attached;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;a very low bridge (maybe the locals wouldn't know how to deal with the gradient of the humpback version).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we passed each feature, another, almost identical, would appear on the horizon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n83/20200729-P1320417.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;4&quot; /&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;One of the many very low bridges.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only flowers we saw were waterlilies, bindweed and the occasional clump of poppies. Sometimes we would see a swan, a black headed gull or a fistful of swifts, or maybe even a cormorant or a cloud of starlings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only human witnesses to our passage had to be looking through a first floor window, walking across a bridge or watching from a cherry picker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was all strangely mesmerising and peaceful until suddenly the RAF would roar into action overhead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n83/20200729-P1320419cropped.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;8&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;It was obvious to me, from watching this bird, that cormorants weren't built to walk along wires.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n83/20200803-P1320875cropped.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;9&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Although RAF planes were often around, I didn't manage to get a decent photo but the American Airforce was much slower....&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We travelled in this way along Whittlesey Dyke to the town of Whittlesey, then through Ashline Lock onto the Old Nene to the town of March.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n83/20200727-P1320297.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;10&quot; /&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;We arrived in Whittlesey to find the pontoon was full so we moored nearby and were grateful for our gangplank.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The official advice was to contact the keeper at Marmont Priory Lock to book passage through to Well Creek. This Tony did and was given a slot at 12:45 which meant we had a bit too much time really, but it was just as well as we travelled most of the way behind a hire boat which was moving so slowly that it felt rather like a slow bicycle race.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, we arrived in plenty of time and moored up at the very short and inadequate pontoon. The boat ahead of us was already rising in the lock. Some time passed and another hire boat arrived. As there was no room for them to moor we took their ropes and put them alongside us. Meanwhile there was plenty of frantic activity and raised voices from the lock ahead. One woman shouted down to us that she was about to open the sluices on the lock gates so we had all better move well back. This put the other hire boat crew into confusion but I suggested that we would be fine where we were. The sluices opened very slowly and the water began to seep out... The water continued to seep out for rather longer than we would have expected, so Tony went up to investigate. He found that the paddles in the top gate had not been closed properly, so the water was passing straight through. He rectified this and the lock finally finished emptying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because the second boat was tied to us, we let them use the lock before us.
Tony went along to help them through and I made us a quick lunch before joining them.
By now our allotted time had been and gone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To check on progress, I approached the lock as an elderly woman was struggling up the steps. She introduced herself as the lock keeper and said she was going to fetch her grand-daughter before helping us, on Liberty Belle, through the lock as arranged.
What? We had helped two hire boats through, who had no idea what they were doing and she had held back until it was our turn! I was flabbergasted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Off she went in her car and Tony and I helped the hire boat though and started emptying the lock whilst we had some lunch then took ourselves through. Just as we were about to leave the lock, the lock keeper and her granddaughter turned up and said they would wind down the last paddle for us. She was eager to chat and I knew Tony was waiting to pick me up. I gathered from what she told me as I backed up the path, that the hire boats were supposed to have been behind us, so she was planning to let them through after she had assisted us. No-one else seemed to be aware of that. I think her system needs a little tweaking...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our next booking was through the Salters Lode Lock to cross the tidal section of the River Great Ouse and exit through Denver Lock. It was a short distance but we only had a very brief window of opportunity to get from one to the other and the whole process has to be carefully coordinated by the lock keepers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two possible problems, getting swept out to sea at Kings Lynn or coming aground (then later either sinking or being swept out to sea at Kings Lynn).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, we were ready and waiting at our allotted time to follow instructions to the letter... It was a slow process but the lock keeper was cheerful and entertaining. Whilst we were waiting for the all clear from Denver Lock he explained that we should expect a narrow boat coming towards us and a floating pontoon in the mouth of the Denver lock that we should try to avoid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we exited the lock we were facing down river so had to turn very sharply towards the lock, upstream of us. We waved to the other boat and nipped around the pontoon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Success!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, we had taken note of the very difficult angle we would have to negotiate to get back into the Salters Lode Lock on our return journey. That may not be quite so straight forward...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Waiting patiently for the go-ahead to cross the tidal river to Denver Lock&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the Middle Levels we had the River Great Ouse and its tributaries, Wissey, Little Ouse and Lark to explore, but first we took the opportunity to visit Downham Market, which was just a lock and a few miles away along the River Great Ouse Relief Channel. We didn't realise how slow the lock was going to be or indeed how slow the people using it ahead of us were... It was painful to watch but we remained upbeat and luckily found a mooring just where we had hoped to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Returning from Downham Market and re-entering the lock through to the River Great Ouse.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rivers are beautiful and were shown to their best advantage in the sunshine. The water was usually so clear that we were able to watch the fish darting about amongst the weed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We saw more variety in the flowers along the banks, there were dragonflies in great numbers along with butterflies and an abundance of thistledown!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were heron and Great Crested Grebes stationed at regular intervals, cormorants and terns were plentiful, as were the acrobatic swallow and house martin display teams. Swans and ducks were out in force, especially around the towns and villages where bread was in plentiful supply. There were geese everywhere, some of which began to take to the skies in typical V-shaped formation. Also spotted were Common Sandpipers, a group of which flew in front of the boat for quite some time one afternoon and gave me an opportunity to see them close up. We were spoilt by so many kingfisher sightings, each one a delight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hoped to moor at the end of each tributary and explore locally. At the end of the River Wissey was Stoke Ferry, then Brandon at the end of the Little Ouse. We didn't quite get into Brandon to moor because the last lock was far too short! It must be one of those left at their original length. We discovered this when I realised I wouldn't be able to close the gates. Tony had to do the reverse of shame, turn and moor near the lock, trying to avoid all the youngsters jumping into the river and swimming around near the lock and pontoon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We walked the short distance into Brandon for a look around, then returned along the Little Ouse.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;When we arrived at our desired mooring place there wasn't much room left so we had to do our best with long ropes and gangplanks.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On one particular day on the River Lark, we had already seen several kingfishers flashing from tree to tree along the length of the river, as they do, when we ran out of trees along the bank. Suddenly, there was a kingfisher, hovering several feet above the water in front of the boat. It stayed there for a considerable amount of time, suspended in the sunlight, before it dived and then flew off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was absolutely magical, like a flashing blue lantern leading the way. Presumably, having no overhanging branches in its territory from which to perch and watch for prey, it had learnt to hover above the river. Now that's something we will never forget.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n83/20200803-P1320856.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;42&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;That'll do nicely.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n83/IMG_20200802_155836975.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;43&quot; /&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Cheers!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;A tricky turn outside Jude's Ferry, over a sunken bathtub.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back on the main river, which, after some of the narrow sections we had done recently, looked enormously wide. Our biggest hazard were the scullers, (one of them nursing a drowning sheep), although they were generally very cautious and some even had mirrors to check behind them. How sensible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We arrived in Ely, which is beautiful, so we decided to stay for a visit.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Happy Anniversary!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another year has passed since we purchased Liberty Belle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My goodness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In those two years we have weathered all kinds of weather and completed 2635 miles and 2014 locks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/maps/Year1-2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Our route&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The map of our journey so far.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were wondering what we could tell you in this special anniversary edition because, contrary to popular belief, I don't like to repeat myself too much... Then we had an email from Aub, (Liberty Belle's Fishing Consultant and possibly our most avid reader), posing a few questions. Perfect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will do our best to answer them but please bear in mind that this is what we think today, in this moment. Ask us again, another day, and we might well say something else...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;When was the first morning you woke up and realised you had embarked on something quite special and couldn’t wait for the adventure to unfold?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, I think we feel like this every time we have a new stretch of the network ahead of us, but the first time must have been the day we set off through our first set of locks. We had loaded our own belongings into Liberty Belle a couple of days before, Tarka and I had spent the first night under the M1 and a day in the pouring rain cleaning and finding homes for all our posessions whilst we waited for Tony to join us after taking back the hire van. We woke up to sunshine, cheerful lock keepers and the pretty Watford Locks with the whole network of canals and rivers ahead of us!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n82/20180825-DSCN0452.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;2&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Watford Locks&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;What has been the best bit so far?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This should be a very difficult one, there have been so many and such varied highlights, however, we both agree that Yorkshire is the best. (Garry will be pleased).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's not just the fabulous scenery, which is undeniable, or the well kept canals and locks but also the friendliness, camaraderie and humour of the people, of all backgrounds and ages. They were out in force, in family groups and friendship groups, walking, jogging, cycling or just watching the world go by but always chatting amongst themselves. Dad and son discussing politics in the bar, Dad and daughter out for an ice-cream, Mum and the kids walking miles uphill to visit a 'beach', Dad and the kids walking over the hill to the railway station after spending the night together under canvas, groups of retired men that have known each other for years just meeting up for a walk, three generations of a family out on their bikes. Joggers didn't just rush by, they smiled, stopped, asked how you were. It's a different world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n82/20190801-P1250951.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;3&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;A little snippet of Yorkshire.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;The most difficult bit?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Kennet and Avon, especially through Reading. If you need lessons in making life difficult for boaters, ask Reading, they know.
&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n82/20190414-P4140898.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;4&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;&quot;I'll go as slowly as I can and you lean out and press the button...&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;The most frightening bit?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, the two locks where Liberty Belle nearly sank are the obvious answers, but, in a way, the more frightening times are when we have a chance to worry about them beforehand, like tidal bits of rivers. The Thames for one, and the River Great Ouse for another. (You won't know about this yet, the story is yet to come!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n82/20200322-P1300188.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;5&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Here we go!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;The most satisfying bit?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oddly, it was the tidal section of the Thames. Tony was determined that we would do it and I was hoping that I wouldn't have to face it. It took a lot of planning and organising. Tony reassured me that we wouldn't go unless the conditions were perfect and then we went anyway! Being so worried actually heightened our senses, so we were able to appreciate everything, and of course, we had Cathy with us as our calming influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n82/20200322-P1300205.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;6&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Tony looking stoic and Cathy looking calm.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;The most memorable bit?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have thought a lot about this one and have to cheat by giving several answers. Aside from all the memorable bits above, we would have to say:-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bristol. We like Bristol as a city anyway but it was amazing to be able to moor right outside the cafe that Cathy was managing and have so many members of the family together on the boat at once. It was rather special.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n82/20190428-P4281219.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;7&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Out to play in Bristol with Mary and Joe.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n82/20190429-P4291247.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;8&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Leaving Bristol with Cathy as skipper.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paddington. The moorings in Paddington are modern, neat and bustling. Being right outside the railway station was very convenient for exploring London. We were so chuffed to be able to moor there for a whole week and explore the city at our own pace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n82/IMG-20190525-WA0001.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;9&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Moored outside Paddington Station.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Liverpool docks. Mooring in Liverpool docks meant we actually became part of the city's attractions. We were able to explore the city from our own doorstep, even popping back for lunch if we felt like it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n82/20190911-P1260941.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;10&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Liverpool Docks.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stratford on Avon. Again, here, we became part of the attraction and were able to explore the area at our leisure. Stratford is a place I already liked but I had never before had enough time there to just take it all in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n82/20180927-DSCN0789.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;11&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Stratford On Avon moorings.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;When were you the coldest?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At breakfast time in the winter. This is the basic truth. We don't make a fire in the mornings if we are setting off soon, but even if we do, it takes an hour or so to heat up the boat. We can't use the radiators until the domestic batteries have been charged either by the engine running or by sunshine on the solar panels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n82/IMG-20200129-WA0000.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;12&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Brrrrr....&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Where on the adventure surprised you the most and why?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Golly, we have little surprises almost every day. Here are 3 pleasant ones. Ask us on another day and we will probably give you a different selection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We weren't expecting anything of Bollington, near Macclesfield but I would have moved in. It had lovely old buildings, it was neat, clean, friendly and it had lots of local footpaths through the surrounding countryside with wonderful views.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The town of Tring in the Chilterns was a surprise because, for a small place, it has so much to offer including a Natural History Museum and a country park with walks and trails.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reach is a tiny village in Cambridgeshire and we only stopped there because it was at the end of our navigation and there was a mooring space. We felt obliged to visit, as we were there. It has the Devil's Dyke passing right through the middle of it and apparently has held a fair there every year since 1201 (except, of course, this year. There is no mention of the black death stopping it, but I expect it did.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n82/IMG-20190721-WA0000.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;13&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n82/20190608-P6082285.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;14&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The ever-surprising Tring.

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n82/IMG_20200806_083919023_HDR.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;15&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Reach.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;On your visits home what do you look forward to the most?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our own flushing toilet and having the chance to catch up with friends, although we are never there long enough to see many people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Do you ever think you would quite happily stay at the house a bit longer?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes. We are always frustrated that we don't get as much done at the house as we had hoped but are always pleased and excited to get back to Liberty Belle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And lastly, some questions that I made up myself because I want to answer them...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;After 2 years travelling around the network, is there anywhere now that feels a bit like home?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Birmingham&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Braunston&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Banbury&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our travels have taken us back to some places several times, but not all of them have the same effect on us. When we approach any one of these three places, we get a thrill of recognition and a cosy feeling of home. Strange but true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;One of Banbury's spandrels.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Tony, what are the most annoying aspects of the boating life?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Emergency Plumbing - most DIY really but the plumbing jobs tend to be more destructive.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Adjusting the tension on the alternator belts with only two hands (and the heel of one foot) while perched astride a warm or hot engine.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Cold, wet cruising days - we said we wouldn't do this but sometimes you have to and sometimes it starts off ok and then you get caught out!&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Cold mornings wrapped in a blanket waiting for breakfast.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Showering in a cubicle which is too small with ice cold tiles to brush against.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Shaving.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not really a boating problem but shaving on a boat usually involves not quite enough light and water a little cooler than ideal. I remember my dad when he was about my age complaining of the unceasing need to shave every day. I now do the same complaining. The alternative of not shaving doesn't suit me either!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Toilet emptying.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our toilet waste is stored in a plastic cassette, or what has been called a suitcase, which has to be emptied every few days into a suitable disposal point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; This usually consists of a cubicle containing a large stainless steel funnel shaped hole in an easy to clean stainless steel housing. Nearby there is usually a tap which can be used to swish it all clean. There used to be a short hose attached to the tap to enable this to be done efficiently but now, because there is a risk of foul water being syphoned back into the water main, these have mostly been removed making it impossible to clean up properly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consequently there is a 'build up'. If you have ever looked at the nests of pigeons under bridges you will note that each year their nest becomes taller and taller until ultimately they are squashed against the top of the bridge. The cause is similar!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, there is a breed of  boaters who make no attempt to clean up after themselves even if it is possible. As an aside, these smelly cubicles will often contain a sign reading&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;signtranscript&quot;&gt;'Not Drinking Water'&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing has ever been further from my mind!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Rachel, what are the most annoying aspects of the boating life?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Attempting to keep the carpet clean.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Finding somewhere to keep the ever increasing pile of re-cycling whilst we wait for the rare opportunity to put it in an appropriate bin, only to find that someone else has already contaminated the contents.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Arriving at a lock to find that the last boaters abandoned it with the paddles up, so I have to do their job as well as my own.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;If you turn your back on anything in the boat for a short while, it gets incorporated into a spider's web. Items in the drainer, washing, fruit, binoculars....anything. When we bought Liberty Belle she came complete with several bottles of 'No More Spiders', something I had never heard of and would never use. I thought the previous owners must have had a phobia but now I understand.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Tony, what are your favourite things about this boating life?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Moving off from our moorings on a crisp sunny morning.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Sitting cosily under a duvet with a coal fire.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Finding a beautiful, secure mooring with bollards or rings just where you wanted it to be.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Eating the lovely meals that Rachel creates daily.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Eating fried up jacket potatoes cooked overnight in the embers of the coal fire (or sometimes incinerated..).&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Discovering, unexpectedly, something unusual in a village we are passing through.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Rachel, what are your favourite things about this boating life?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Setting off early in the morning, with the weather in our favour and the whole day to look forward to.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;People waving.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Watching the birds and animals we see along the way.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The silly conversations Tony and I have about what we see as we chug along.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Exploring the places we pass though and finding something fascinating.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Singing to myself as I walk along the towpath, from lock to lock, with no-one to hear me.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;At the end of a long day, feeling tired but happy and ready to settle down in front of the fire.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;There now. I bet you wish you hadn't asked!&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;20th-27th July 2020&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/maps/n80map.png&quot; alt=&quot;Our route&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Our route&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n80/IMG_20200721_145605262_HDR.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;One of many old mills on the River Nene.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After having had our new fire extinguishers successfully delivered, we moved through the last lock on the Northampton Arm and onto the River Nene. How exciting! It was especially exciting because we hadn't got a proper map, so were not entirely sure where we would have access to moorings or facilities, and we weren't entirely convinced that we had the right equipment to operate the locks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apparently, Nene can be pronounced to rhyme with &quot;pen&quot; (if you are West of Peterborough), or to rhyme with &quot;gene&quot; if you are East of the city. So far we have only heard it pronounced &quot;Nen&quot; once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n80/20200720-P1310984.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;2&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The lock onto the River Nene.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n80/20200720-P1320009.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;3&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The Nene in Northampton.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since he began planning this section of our journey, (back in Henley), Tony has been obsessed with measuring and re-measuring Liberty Belle, to see if we were likely to fit under the bridges on the Middle Levels, between the Nene and the Great Ouse. He had come to the conclusion that we might make it if we have a full tank of water to keep Liberty Belle low enough. Even so, he still keeps measuring...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will need yet another key and a different windlass for the Middle Levels too, but we should be able to purchase them when we get there, so that concern is for another day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The locks on the River Nene are different in that they have a guillotine gate at one end. (We came across one of these in Todmordon and it didn't go well. &lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn1&quot; id=&quot;ref1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n80/20200721-P1320046.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;4&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Liberty Belle faces the guillotine!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In times of flood the guillotine gate is lowered and the upstream lock gates are padlocked open. The guillotine gates are then operated as a sluice gate, letting through as much or as little water as is required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of these gates are operated electronically and to access the control buttons you need a particular key which also opens any padlocks on the gates. Whilst we were moored in Northampton, Tony tested one of Liberty Belle's mystery keys on the padlock attached to the gate of our first Nene Lock. It fitted! He also checked that one of our many windlasses fitted, which it did. Excellent. That saved us from having to manoeuvre Liberty Belle in and out of the Northampton Marina before we left, to buy them. (We tried accessing the marina on foot but couldn't find our way in.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n80/IMG_20200722_122102486.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;4&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Most of the Nene guillotine lock gates are operated using one of these control panels...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n80/IMG_20200722_154417737_HDR.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;5&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;...but others require more physical effort.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, fully equipped for the next leg of the journey, we were off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The River Nene is absolutely beautiful and the weather showed it off at its best. We watched cormorants, heron, terns, an occasional kingfisher and even an oyster catcher. I decided that if I couldn't see a Red Kite at any point, I simply wasn't trying hard enough, there were so many.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n80/20200721-P1320010.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;6&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Leaving Northampton behind and...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;...passing through the automatic flood gates.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;One of the many pretty bridges across the Nene.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n80/20200723-P1320172.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;10&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;A different style, but equally pretty bridge.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n80/20200723-P1320179.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;11&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Many of the locks have lovely old mill buildings next to them. Many, like this one, have found new uses but others are derelict.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n80/20200721-P1320033.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;12&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;A bit of quality family time.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n80/IMG-20200722-WA0006.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;13&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Ditchford Lock is the last of the traditional radial locks on the Nene. The gate is curved and swings in an arc when opening and closing.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n80/20200723-P1320182.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;14&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Wow! Just!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n80/20200722-P1320111.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;15&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Apparently iris leaves are very tasty indeed. We later saw a goat trying to eat them too.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately our plan to stop off to explore the towns and villages on the way didn't come to much because the moorings were either non-existent, surrounded by private land with no access, or already full of boats (or boat, singular). This meant that we had long days sitting on the back of the boat with beautiful views but no breaks. So, despite the river turning out to be much longer than we thought and winding with sharp bends, we still made good time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n80/20200721-P1320066.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;16&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Yes, we are members.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;It was very, very long...!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;We had a little look around the village.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The mooring at Thrapston. It was tricky to approach. There wasn't enough room for us. It was trickier still to reverse away.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n80/20200723-P1320168.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;25&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Lovely lunchtime mooring. This one was tricky too but only because the strong wind was against us.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the 23rd, after a long day of searching for an overnight mooring, we arrived in Fotheringhay where we stopped at Castle Farm, which we had hoped to avoid because we knew there would be an overnight charge. However, it wan't expensive so we decided to stay for two nights to give us a chance to explore the local area on foot. We found a circular walk, taking in the villages of Nassington, (where we had a flask of coffee and biscuits), Yarwell Mill where there was a lockside cafe that it would be rude to ignore, so we stopped for tea and cake, then the village of Elton, where we had a pint in the pub garden followed by our picnic on a bench on the green. Quite a nice day!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst we were walking through Nassington we came across a notice board in someone's front garden. It was shaped like a stork carrying a bundle, and on it was announced the birth of twins a few days before. As we were admiring it an elderly gentleman on the other side of the road shouted over to us that the twins had brought down the average age of the villagers to 98! Hehehe!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;In the background is Fotheringhay's very impressive Church of St Mary and All Saints.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Nassington, a small and neat village.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Yarwell Junction railway station. Normally, steam trains run between here and  Peterborough.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst in Fotheringhay, Tony booked passage through the lock in Peterborough that would take us from the River Nene onto The Middle Level Navigations. This is operated by a lock keeper and at least 24 hours notice needs to be given. We were given a slot for 10 a.m. on Monday morning, which would give us the weekend in Peterborough. We hoped we would find a suitable mooring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following day we set off for Peterborough, stopping off at the Yarwell Mill Lock for bacon butties from the lockside cafe....!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;On the other it says &quot;County of Soke of Peterborough&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We finally arrived in Peterborough to find that there was enough mooring space for a fleet! We decided not to bunch in with the boats nearest the town because one of them seemed to have a loud party going on already at 3 in the afternoon, so we gave ourselves a bit of space and moored a little further along.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Our Peterborough mooring.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Long, long ago, when I was a schoolgirl, we had lived in Stamford, a town near Peterborough, and Mary has kept in touch with a couple who still live there. I arranged to meet up with them whilst we were in the area and they seemed keen to see Liberty Belle. It was lovely to have a good old natter about the past and this 'n' that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also took our chance to do some shopping and visit Peterborough Cathedral. It is an interesting town with lots of history but the museum was closed so we felt we were missing out. The Cathedral is a dramatic and beautiful building but we did feel that the visit was dampened by the wearing of masks, steamed up glasses, a one way system and hand sanitising stations. All this is necessary and reasonable and we are happy to go along with it but it certainly takes the glory out of things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Monday morning, after filling up with water, we braved the wet and windy weather to keep our appointment with the lock keeper, a lovely, chatty lady.  She sold us the required key and windlass, gave us a guide book and sent us on our way, on the new leg of our journey, with a smile, a little advice and a cheerful wave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Robin at the helm.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After our week at the house, Robin kindly loaded us back into his car and returned us to Liberty Belle, waiting patiently for us in Thrupp. Without delay we left our mooring and soon discovered that Robin was still on board, so we gave him the job of helmsman all the way to Banbury.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the way we searched for otters, crayfish and a pub serving beer. (Two out of three ain't bad...)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n79/20200709-P1310877.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;2&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Concentrating...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n79/20200708-P1310873.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;3&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Tony taking a turn at operating the locks.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We did a bit of gongoozling at a lock whilst out for a short walk and spotted a small ring on the right hand side of the bow of a narrow boat, which puzzled us. Robin questioned the owner who said it was for springing the boat which he suggested involved roping either the stern or the bow to a post when turning. I asked why there wasn't another ring on the other side of the bow, to which he had no answer. This of course set the boys off searching for information on 'springing' a boat and was the topic of conversation for quite some considerable time...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We concluded that the attachment that we had seen was unsuitable for the job the owner had told us it was for. Sometime later we saw another boat with the same attachment. This owner told us it was for tying on the anchor. Now that sounds more plausible. He also suggested that every narrow boat has a specific fixture for this purpose. Hmmm, Liberty Belle, you seem to be lacking in that department.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During this part of our journey, there was a small incident involving our radio aerial and a low bridge, which, despite the fact that it could have happened to any of us at any time, Tony will never let Robin forget...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some time later, as Tony was driving, a small overhanging oak twig brushed along the top of the boat and got caught under one of the solar panels, bringing down the enormous branch that it was attached to! Carnage!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n79/20200708-P1310863.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;4&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Oops!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n79/20200709-P1310890.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;5&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Oops again!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the 9th July we had reached Banbury. After Robin had been shown the Banbury Budgies and we had all eaten a Fish &amp;amp; Chip lunch, Robin caught his bus back to his car at Thrupp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We stayed in Banbury for a couple more nights to wait for our annual, (due last February), service of Liberty Belle's fire safety equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the scaffolding for the building site alongside the canal was expanded to include our mooring space, so getting on and off the boat became increasingly difficult. When Ben arrived to service, (or rather, replace), our fire extinguishers, he had muddled us up with another boat and had brought the wrong stuff....so we are now due to meet him again in Northampton.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh well, it had given Tony time to service the engine and install his new and updated wooden fixtures on the boat, for us to have a nice walk locally and for me to do some shopping and cooking for the journey ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n79/20200714-P1310893.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;6&quot; /&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, as soon as Ben had left, we had lunch, managed to untie from bollards under the scaffolding and went on our way. My goodness it was busy! For some reason we seemed to be going in the opposite direction to most boats, so we didn't have to queue for long at the locks. We were so pleased to be travelling that we chose to spend long days on the move watching the world go by.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meadowsweet was interspersed with the purple of vetch and cranesbill flowers, and the pink of willow herbs, making a beautiful border to the canal. The butterflies and dragonflies were plentiful and the weather mostly sunny and warm as we travelled along the familiar Oxford Canal.  We still spotted the occasional newly hatched brood of ducks or moorhens but alongside all this summer delight were reminders that autumn is around the corner. Some of the young waterbirds were almost indistinguishable from their adults and in the hedgerows the hard, green hips, haws, sloes and elderberries, are biding their time...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we arrived in Napton we were very lucky to find a mooring outside the delightful Folly Inn. As we were ahead of schedule, there was no need to rush off the next day, so we stayed for lunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n79/IMG_20200715_162442688.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;8&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The Garden of The Folly, all set up for socially distanced dining. It worked very well but just isn't the same as being in a cosy pub.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Napton we turned onto the Grand Onion heading towards Northampton, passing through Braunston and Norton junctions. It was very busy and hard going but fun. The locks were now double width and so we all tried to share locks where we could. Often boats would moor up or other boats would set off so partnerships were made and lost, but we all did what we could to help keep the traffic flowing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was lots of chatter with the usual &quot;Where are you heading for?&quot;, &quot;Where do you hope to moor tonight?&quot; and &quot;How long are you out for?&quot; interspersed with the new &quot;Where were you Locked down?&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n79/20200717-P1310919.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;10&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;We moored briefly at Braunston turn to buy Braunston Bangers. A tradition of ours!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n79/IMG_20200718_100813818_HDR.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;11&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;These traditional mile markers have been replaced, sponsored by various groups and individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n79/IMG_20200718_100916776.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;12&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Tony, back at the helm.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We finally reached Gayton Junction on the 19th and turned onto the Northampton Arm to face the series of 16 locks into Northampton. We were warned by a boater that one of the pounds between the locks was low, so we knew it was going to be slow going. We moored at the top and went to investigate. Three locks down and we could see that the pound was indeed too low to navigate. Between us Tony and I started letting water through from the top of the flight by opening both the top and bottom paddles of each lock until the water was at its normal height.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We then brought Liberty Belle through. Just as we were in the second lock, a Canal &amp;amp; River Trust engineer appeared over the breast of the hill. Apparently, what we had sorted out was the very least of it! He had a completely dry pound at the other end of the flight. He asked us to sit tight for 45 minutes whilst he let more water through all the way to the other end. So, Tony tied Liberty Belle to try to keep her steady as she surfed the wave in the lock and I put the kettle on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n79/20200719-P1310928.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;13&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Liberty Belle surfing the wave as water passes through the lock to fill the pounds below.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once we had the go-ahead we continued our journey, passing only one boat on the way. It was hard work but straightforward. After the locks we noticed we were being followed by a tern, swooping and diving behind the boat for a considerable time. Liberty Belle must have been stirring up the fish for him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n79/20200719-P1310965cropped.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;15&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;...and diving.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We finally arrived at our destination, only to find that the mooring space was full! We ended up having to reverse back along the canal but Liberty Belle was very well behaved and it proved to be more simple than we had thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tony then proceeded to collect all the dog mess from the vicinity of the boat, to make our visit more pleasant. After he had collected four very full bags and we were settling in, one of the moored boats moved off. We untied and moved forwards again into his space. Oh well, that was Tony's good deed for the week!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here Liberty Belle's old Fire Extinguishers were finally exchanged for new ones and we were ready, (maybe), for our trip on the River Nene!
But that's another story...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Footnotes:-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;fn1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;The Salt Way is part of an ancient track that was used to transport salt from Droitwich to London and the South of England.&lt;a href=&quot;#ref1&quot; title=&quot;Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.&quot;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Where Next?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The River Nene isn't covered by the Collins Canal and River Maps that we normally use on our travels, so Tony has spent a lot of time online trying to gather information about the river, its locks and the facilities available to boaters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He joined the Friends of the River Nene some months ago in anticipation of our journey. We have discovered that one of the mystery keys we have had on board all along opens the padlocks and operating consoles along the river and that our collection of windlasses should be sufficient until we get to the mysterious Middle Levels. We have decided to deal with them when we get there...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are currently heading for Peterborough. Sadly, the lock that allows access to the tidal section of the River Nene, and ultimately to The Wash, is out of order. Phew!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rachel Glombek</name></author><category term="LibertyBelle" /><summary type="html">From Thrupp to Northampton 6th - 20th July 2020</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Close Encounters of the Bovine Kind</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/libertybellenewsletter/libertybelle/2020/07/20/close-encounters-of-the-bovine-kind.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Close Encounters of the Bovine Kind" /><published>2020-07-20T20:38:00+01:00</published><updated>2020-07-20T20:38:00+01:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/libertybellenewsletter/libertybelle/2020/07/20/close-encounters-of-the-bovine-kind</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/libertybellenewsletter/libertybelle/2020/07/20/close-encounters-of-the-bovine-kind.html">&lt;h2&gt;From Henley to Thrupp&lt;/h2&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Everywhere on the Thames!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We left Henley early on the morning of 22nd June in the hope of getting a few miles done before the day was out. As it happened, we were too early for the warden's rounds, so some might say, rather unkindly, that we did a moonlight flit...&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The surrounding crash barriers suggest we have a good chance of hitting this bridge...
&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the next few days we made our way along the Thames to Lechlade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our progress was slowed by:-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;a small boat closing a lock door in our faces and leaving us behind;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;a lock that was out of order and couldn't be operated. (After calling the appropriate number several times we were eventually rescued by a friendly local lock keeper);&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;the narrow and winding nature of the Thames above Oxford. (It almost turns back on itself at times);&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;the shear number of people playing in the cool water. (Around every corner there was someone jumping in, paddling, rowing or just drifting along on an inflatable).&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the sun shone, the river was pretty and we were all in a holiday mood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All except for the single sculler who suddenly changed course and steered directly into our bow. We were travelling as slowly as we could, having come out of a lock to find ourselves surrounded by people having fun in the water in various ways. He was extremely cross with us. I have no idea what he could have expected us to do...&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We reached Lechlade at lunch time of the 25th June, found a mooring alongside a field and went straight to the Fish &amp;amp; Chip shop which had been mentioned by someone earlier in the day and had played on our minds ever since.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we returned to the boat it was too hot to sit inside, so we arranged our chairs outside and created some shade with an umbrella and some towels. We relaxed there briefly before we were stirred into action by strange sounds behind us, which turned out to be cows attempting to taste the towels!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet again, thanks to my Mother's NVQ Level 1 Cattle Herding Course, I knew exactly what to do and leapt into action. Drawing myself up as large as I could and using the umbrella &lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn1&quot; id=&quot;ref1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; for extra dramatic effect, I told them in a firm and dominant voice that they were to move immediately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually, in their own time, in a rather indifferent manner, they wandered off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to cool off by going for a swim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems that the herd of cows wander around the edge of the field, returning to the moorings several times a day to see if the ropes are edible or the sides of the boats taste good when licked.... According to our neighbour, they begin this routine at 5 a.m. each morning. Hmmmmm...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n78/IMG-20200625-WA0012cropped.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;21&quot; /&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;No, the towels are not edible!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n78/20200625-P1310729.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;23&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;We were able to stay immersed for much longer than in Sunbury!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following morning we travelled the short distance to the official turning point which was extremely shallow, making the manoeuvre rather more difficult than it should have been... It was not a good start to the day, but Tony managed to bring Liberty Belle around and we waved goodbye to the herd of cows before heading back along the Thames looking for a shady mooring that we had heard about. Failing to find it, we got as far as Pinkhill Lock before giving up for the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The joy of successfully turning Liberty Belle under difficult circumstances!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the morning the weather had taken a turn. With the sun in hiding, there were no longer people in the water around every corner, so we made better progress. When we reached Isis Lock, the entrance to the Oxford Canal, my heart did a little leap at the sight of the Canal &amp;amp; River Trust signs. The Thames had been exciting and different but now we were back home on the canal and it felt good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shortly afterwards we met a couple taking their narrow boat in the opposite direction, looking forward to leaving the canal behind and getting back onto the Thames...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n78/20200627-P1310801.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;26&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Yay!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Oxford we travelled North to Thrupp, stopping on the way to collect the new hairclippers that Tony had ordered online when I declared, a few days before, that I needed my hair cutting off. The impracticality of long hair had finally tipped me over the edge. 
Once we arrived in Thrupp we squeezed into a 7 day mooring, managing to get all 57 foot 10 inches of Liberty Belle into a 50 foot space. Then Tony wielded the new hairclippers and I was liberated!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Robin kindly came to Thrupp to collect us and a car full of our stuff, then took us back to the house where the washing machine, sewing machine, lawn mower and woodworking tools were fully employed. Tony planted out his many, many willow plants that had been growing like mad in their washing-up bowls on the boat. He had collected them before lockdown, with a view to making a living willow structure back at the house. Fingers crossed that they survive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We managed to visit Mary, (after some difficulty trying to use one of Eastleigh's car club cars), and fitted in some socially distanced visits with some of our lovely neighbours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the last minute Tony discovered a small water leak in the loft which we thought might cause us to delay our return, but he fixed it and all was well...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having not received an email complaining about Liberty Belle bursting out of her mooring space, we had made good use of our 7 (8?) days before Robin returned us to the boat. Thanks Robin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Footnotes:-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;fn1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;Please note that the NVQ Level 1 Cattle Herding Course in no way sanctions the use of umbrellas&lt;a href=&quot;#ref1&quot; title=&quot;Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.&quot;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Where Next?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After much thought, investigation and discussion, we decided that we ought to trim down our travelling plans for this year. We were hoping to get back to Yorkshire before the winter but have decided that would be far too ambitious. We are now planning to go to Northampton and follow the River Nene to Peterborough, then move on to Cambridge. Once we have completed the navigations in that area we will return to the Oxford Canal then the Ashby, hopefully arriving in Birmingham in early September.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rachel Glombek</name></author><category term="LibertyBelle" /><summary type="html">From Henley to Thrupp 21st June - 6th July 2020</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Wey Hey!</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/libertybellenewsletter/libertybelle/2020/06/27/wey-hey.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Wey Hey!" /><published>2020-06-27T22:21:00+01:00</published><updated>2020-06-27T22:21:00+01:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/libertybellenewsletter/libertybelle/2020/06/27/wey-hey</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/libertybellenewsletter/libertybelle/2020/06/27/wey-hey.html">&lt;h2&gt;From Hampton Court to Henley, via the River Wey&lt;/h2&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The end of the last newsletter left us at Hampton Court, where we remained, (with a couple of trips to the lock for water), until a nice man knocked on the boat and declared that the mooring charges would resume the following day. We reassured him that we had been expecting it to happen...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sunken boat beyond Sunbury Lock had been lifted and our way was now clear but we hadn't yet had our long awaited fish and chips from 'The Red Herring' in Sunbury.... As far as we remembered the chip shop didn't open until Wednesday, so we had a couple of days to kill. We decided to travel further back down river to Kingston and top up our supplies from the conveniently positioned Waitrose there. That done, we spent our allocated single night there and then moved to the opposite side of the river for another night, then off back to Sunbury, where our old mooring was waiting and our fish &amp;amp; chip supper didn't disappoint!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n77/IMG_20200606_115526136.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;5&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;...then towed to a local boatyard.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once we had passed through Sunbury lock (and over the sunken boat site) our first task was to get some fuel from Shepperton Marina. Phew, that was a relief.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our next move wasn't quite as obvious. After the sunken boat site was the junction with the River Wey which has the Basingstoke Canal branching off it. We had always hoped to spend a reasonable amount of time exploring this area and, as it is the nearest part of the network to our home ground, we assumed we would catch up with visitors and travel to the house for a while. Work was being carried out on the section of the Wey between Guildford and Godalming and was due to re-open 'mid-June', so there was a chance that we would time that right. However, the Basingstoke Canal was closed. Tony had contacted the appropriate people and pleaded his case. As the government guidance didn't allow for overnight stays anywhere and they had no continuous cruisers on the Basingstoke Canal, there was no reason for it to be opened. Apparently they were not going to do a risk assessment of the entire canal just for us....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The alternative was to pass by the Wey and continue up to Lechlade, leaving the Wey and Basingstoke Canal for another time. We had a feeling that if we took this option, it might never be convenient to return.
We had been told by several people how beautiful the river was, so it would be a shame to by-pass it altogether.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, having decided to travel on the river, we had to purchase the appropriate temporary license from the National Trust, the owners of the navigation. Three days would be sufficient for quick visit to Guildford and back, but a week would enable us to have a socially-distanced visit or two, and there was a chance that the section to Godalming would open in the meantime. If the Basingstoke Canal suddenly opened, we would purchase the separate pass for there, and then pay an extra day for the journey from the canal, along the river, back to the Thames.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good, we finally had a plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n77/20200612-P1310063.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;6&quot; /&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Our River Wey weekly pass.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our week passed by quickly. The river was indeed beautiful, meandering its way through fields lined with trees. The locks were well maintained, (as one would expect from the National Trust), and generally easy to operate. We did however, have to borrow a windlass from the lock keeper because the locking mechanism is very slightly different... It's never straight forward.
The towpaths were quiet; the local wildlife were busy feeding their young; swallows and terns were scooting about around us; Red Kites soaring above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had the scent of meadowsweet on the breeze and glimpses of purple vetch along the banks. Yellow waterlilies were everywhere but as I tried to photograph them they dived underwater,  as if camera-shy. As Liberty Belle pushed through the water, it rushed past her sides and temporarily engulfed the flowers. The presence of so much vegetation in the water was an indication of how shallow it was, and we did indeed come aground on one of the many sharp bends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n77/20200623-P1310628cropped.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;8&quot; /&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Excitingly, we did have some visitors whilst we were there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joe and Kirsty caught up with us when we were moored outside a pub that was selling takeaway food and beer. My goodness, that was good from every aspect!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Carol found us in Guildford, a place she knows well, and Tony was subjected to us having a long-awaited catch-up! (He assures us that he enjoyed it too.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was no sign of us being able to take Liberty Belle along the stretch to Godalming, so we decided to complete it on foot and Robin caught up with us there.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our week was nearly up; we had just 2 days to head back. As we rejoined the Thames, the section of river from Guildford to Godalming was declared open! Oh, fiddlesticks. Rumour has it though, that the repair to the navigation might not hold, so we could have been caught in Godalming and stranded there indefinitely. Perhaps it was for the best that we had missed it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tony has promised that we can travel the Basingstoke Canal by kayak sometime. I am still deciding whether that's a good idea or not...&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The lock keeper at Thames Lock, uses a pole to close the gate on the opposite side.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Personally I prefer the long walk around...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the junction we passed back onto the Thames, travelling through places that we know, at a faster pace this time because nothing is open. As I write this we are back in Henley. We arrived  after a long day's travel. Tony did battle with the mooring pay machine and lost (or rather, won, as it didn't manage to take his money), but then the warden came around the following morning. It seems that the machine rarely works, so they leave people to fight with it until they give up in anger and frustration, then pay a chap to go from boat to boat taking money and writing mooring tickets out by hand. Modern technology at its finest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Where Next?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have arrived in Oxford now and are going to find a suitable mooring before heading back to the house for a few days to get some jobs done. We won't be doing much socialising, even at a distance, because we want to visit Mary.
When we get back to Liberty Belle, we plan to follow the whole length of the Oxford Canal, then venture onto the Ashby Canal, (Keith's favourite!)&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rachel Glombek</name></author><category term="LibertyBelle" /><summary type="html">From Hampton Court to Henley, via the River Wey 4th - 21st June 2020</summary></entry></feed>
