&lt;h2&gt;23rd-31st May 2019&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/maps/NineMonthsMap.png&quot; alt=&quot;A map of the canals we have covered in out first nine months&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;We have been cruising for nine months of our planned two years aiming to cover most of the canal network. This is how much we have covered so far.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;We may need more time!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Our route&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n48/P5231856.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Liberty Belle moopred beside Thames Lock at Brentford&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Welcome&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, there we were on the Thames hoping to travel into London.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going straight down the river is an option for narrowboats and, in fact, Liberty Belle has done that in a previous life, with different crew. However, this involves dealing with the tidal section of the river as well as HUGE boats and even some waves, so I chickened out of that...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other option is to approach London by riding on the back of the Grand Onion, which joins the Thames at Brentford. I thought this would be a much easier option but it still involves a bit of tidal river between Teddington Lock and The Thames Lock in Brentford, so some planning ahead is required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Boaters are required to give 48 hours notice to book passage through the lock at Brentford if the tide isn’t going to be at the correct position during normal lock operating times. One of the options for booking this was by email which seemed sensible as we could put all the relevant information down in writing, to avoid any confusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, on the Monday, an email was sent requesting passage through the Thames Lock at Brentford on the following Thursday at 19:30.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By Wednesday morning we were concerned that no confirmation email had arrived. Tony made a phone call. He was told he was talking to the London office but needed to speak to the Brentford office, so they attempted to put him through. This didn't work so they promised Tony a call back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tony phoned the lock keeper himself, in the hope that he would be of help, but he just repeated the correct procedure for booking. Fair enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No phone call came.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best option seemed to be to alter our plans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right then, plan B.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Get up at 5:00 on Thursday morning, get through Teddington Lock (manned) and get to Brentford Lock for 8:00 when there was a 30 minute window where the lock was going to be manned and the tide was right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the Wednesday afternoon Tony received a phone call (at last) from a woman who explained that we should give 48 hours notice.....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tony explained that we had done that, by email, but we had since altered our plans anyway. He tried to discuss the timings for passing through the locks according to the tide, but the woman on the phone didn't know anything about that....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n48/P5231837.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A view through the bridge at Kingston-Upon-Thames&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Early morning start.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Passing under the bridge at Kingston-Upon-Thames.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, on the Thursday morning we got up at 5:00 and arrived at Teddington lock at 6:15. All went smoothly. The Lock Keeper, feeling chatty, asked us our plans for the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We’re going to go through the Tidal Lock at Brentford”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Looking concerned) “That won’t be operated until 8 o’clock”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We know. How long does it take to get there then?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“An hour and 20 minutes.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Looking confused)“So that should be just right then….”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You’ll be alright if the tide holds up otherwise you’ll be in the mud”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This conversation wasn’t very reassuring really.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n48/P1240899.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A view of Richmond Lock&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;I think it is Liberty Belle that is a bit tippy, not the lock...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Boldly onwards!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily Tony had taken the time and trouble to look on the internet at pictures of the turning from the Thames towards the Brentford Lock, otherwise we would have gone straight past it. There was a distinctive metal sculpture there, which Tony recognised just in time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, turning the corner, we arrived at the Thames Lock, Brentford, at 7:45. Perfect. There was surprisingly little room for boats to wait there. Already a small boat was tied up to a bollard in the lock mouth. There was another bollard, several feet above our heads, to the right of the lock. It would mean some reversing and faffing when the lock opened but there was no choice. Tony managed to tie Liberty Belle (precariously) to that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, with only one rope tied and the water slowly dropping, we waited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;8:00 came and no lock keeper arrived.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Liberty Belle was being slowly lowered towards the muddy bottom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;8:15. Still no lock keeper. Tony tried to phone the lock keeper with no luck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually, at 8:17, almost at the end of our 30 minute window, the lock keeper arrived and let us into the lock. Wow. Talk about stressful...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We passed through onto the canal. I was so relieved I wanted to cry!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We immediately found a mooring, 14 days for free with our own tap. Joy! (We only wanted one night but it was nice to have the option!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n48/P5241883.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Liberty Belle mored under a covered wharf&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Our mooring in Brentford.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was still early, so we walked to Kew Gardens to spend the rest of the day. On the way, Tony had a phone call in response to our request to book passage through the Brentford Lock.....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The least colourful of Chihuly's Glass sculptures on display in Kew
but it was my personal favourite.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a stressful start, we had a delightful day at Kew and headed off the following morning. Golly, it's nice to be on a canal!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n48/P5241890.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Hanwell Locks and the wall of St Bernard's Hospital.&quot; /&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;More city dwelling cormorants...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John and Melissa managed to find us, (despite public transport trying to confuse them and get them lost!) and joined us for our journey into Paddington.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were delighted to find a 7 day mooring directly outside the station! Amazing!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The four of us went for an evening meal together. We had fish and chips so posh that we had a bottle of wine with it! Tony and I didn’t even know that was an option!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n48/IMG-20190525-WA0010.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Liberty Belle moored outside Paddington station.&quot; /&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Our mooring for the week.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Outside Paddington Station, behind a 'Party Boat'.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was the start of a busy week exploring London on foot and by tube.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As well as spending some time with John and Melissa, we had a visit from Kirsty, with her mother &amp;amp; brother, and Robin joined us for a day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* 'The Julia Tour of London'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many thanks to Julia who guided us by text message around an area of London which she knows well. We wouldn't have discovered these treasures on our own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If all your guide books are at home the Bot, Julia, can be consulted and will provide useful information free of charge! Sometimes the information comes unprovoked. Thus...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;conversationlisten&quot;&gt;Julia: If you're anywhere near St Paul's/Barbican   ...Postman's Park is an interesting little diversion ..and free&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;conversationlisten&quot;&gt;Julia: Which is close to the sunken The Goldsmiths' Garden - small but beautiful at this time of year and also free&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;conversationtalk&quot;&gt;Tony: Thanks, may do Museum of London in Barbican so that would fit in nicely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;conversationlisten&quot;&gt;Julia: Ooh yes, that's at No 1 London Walls - just round the corner. Also very close is Little Britain ( just a road really) but if you then walk say, after the museum, through Little Britain  and then take a dog leg through St Barts, toward Smithfield, you go past a very ancient church which is beautiful inside and out - I'll look up its name. .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;conversationtalk&quot;&gt;Rachel: Julia  knows everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;conversationlisten&quot;&gt;Julia: Turns out it's called St Bartholomews! !! anyway there's a St Bartholomews the Great and The Less, it's ancient and fabulous. There's stuff on Google about it.   And the dog leg is a right/left, not a left/right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;conversationtalk&quot;&gt;Rachel: Thank you! We have an exciting day ahead!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;conversationlisten&quot;&gt;Julia: Then if you walked through Smithfield you could walk down St John Street /Road to St John's Gate which is not only the home of St John's ambulance but also the only original City gate still in tact and in its original position. This is very close to the Jerusalem inn -  best pub in London.  Also, the Three Kings in Clerkenwell is not far away - also a good pub. All thus is free except the pubs - obvs&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;conversationlisten&quot;&gt;Julia: If you do the St John's part of that walk,  just pop down Peter's Lane/White Horse Alley on your left to take a look at the building with cow/sheep heads going all the way up to the top.
Sorry, it's the Jerusalem Tavern not Inn and is closed at the weekends as it's in the city. Not far  to stumble then to Faringdon tube.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;conversationlisten&quot;&gt;Julia: This is the only bit of London I know&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;conversationtalk&quot;&gt;Rachel: Fabulous, thank you!&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Moored in central Newbury, yards from the shops.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Not far from the excellent 'Harrison's Coffee' shop which has been serving coffee, as the sign says, 'Since 2018' .&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After leaving Newbury we made our way towards Reading. We were accompanied by Black-Headed Gulls and terns swooping around us, as well as the sight and heady smell of hawthorn flowers. I witnessed one tern scooping a fish from the water, which was very exciting!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n47/P5161587.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A herd of cows heading for a drink across the towpath&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;These big beasts (some with very long, sharp horns), met me on the towpath!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;I had to bring to mind my Mother's cow herding advice...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n47/P5161591.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Rachel on the towpath relieved having survived the cows&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Post cow herding success. Thanks Mum!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We teamed up with a very smart Dutch barge style narrowboat called Sterrenstof, which I had admired when I saw it moored in Newbury. With the addition of this friendly crew of four, the locks and swing bridges were made much easier. We had planned to moor Liberty Belle for the night just before the tricky Reading locks but, as our partner boat was continuing through Reading, we decided to stick with them. Although the weirs here did make negotiating the locks just as difficult as we had expected, travelling together made it less worrying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n47/P1240703.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A swan with her brood of four cygnets swimming&quot; /&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Plenty of swans have had sucessful broods.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n47/P1240657.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A pair of geese with their brood of three goslings swimming&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;... and the geese!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once we reached the Thames we parted company, Sterrenstoff turned left and we turned right, towards Henley-on-Thames, where we were hoping to catch up with Chris and Sara.
The gulls and terns were on the river too, as well as Great Crested Grebes, Egyptian Geese, Mandarin Ducks... we even saw a Sparrowhawk which was being mobbed by starlings.
Our binoculars became invaluable, enabling us to read any notices along the bank from a distance. In this way we could find where to moor before it was too late and we were committed to passing by!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n47/P5161609.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A view of the Thames from Liberty Belle&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;So wide!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The locks on the Thames are very large, electrically operated and quite often manned by lock keepers. The rules are to switch off your engine and use the stern and bow ropes to keep the boat in position, close to the edge. All types of boats are mixed in together, so keeping big steel boats from knocking into plastic ones, or even inflatables, is vital. In manned locks this was easy, Tony took the stern and I took the bow. It was trickier when there was no lock keeper. In one case the plastic boat we were sharing with was a lone boater and one of us needed to press the buttons. Usually you can press each button in turn and rush back to your position at the ropes but in this instance, the buttons needed to be pressed for 10 seconds every 2 minutes to operate the sluices so Tony was on his own rope-wise. It all went smoothly but it was a bit tense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n47/P5171619.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A house with a boathouse underneath for sale on the Thames&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;We spotted this semi for sale but Liberty Belle pointed out that the boat house was a bit short, so we didn't go ahead with the purchase...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just before Henley-on-Thames, the lock keeper suggested we travel past the moorings towards the centre of town before turning and tying up at the first mooring we come to, as near Henley as possible. Cunning! We are not used to having such a wide expanse of water to turn whenever we feel like it. The moorings were lovely and convenient but needed to be paid for. Fair enough...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n47/P5171633.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The New Orleans paddle steamer owned by Hobbs of Henley&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;A Paddle Steamer!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Well, sort of...it has a diesel engine. It was built to be as large as possible but still fit into the locks and pass under the Henley bridge&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following morning, through a cloud of mayflies, we watched a pair of coots making their nest whilst we waited for our visitors. The male coot spent his time swimming off to find nesting material, proudly returning with a stick or leaf in his beak which he presented to the female to arrange in the nest, then immediately dashing off to find the next one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chris and Sara found us and were introduced, first to Liberty Belle and then to the delights of Wetherspoons!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After second breakfast there, we had a little look around the town and went into the tourist information office. The extremely efficient employee there told us that we would like to go for a walk, which direction we would like to go in and gave us a train timetable to help us get back. Golly!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, as per instructions, we followed the Thames Path. Strangely it left the river at the lock and continued away from the Thames to the railway station. Here we found a pub garden, where we had a pint in the sunshine. We then turned back, planning to retrace our steps before following the path in the opposite direction, hopefully along the river. As we approached Liberty Belle, it began to rain so we sat in the boat and watched the coots, still building their nest. The rain became very heavy which seemed to clear away the mayflies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n47/IMG-20190518-WA0005.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Chris and Sara join us on the deck of Liberty Belle&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Visitors!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day the coots' nest was empty and there was no sign of the owners...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we left Henley we found ourselves confronted with the Regatta route. The river was divided into 3 lanes, each one wide enough for several large boats - the one on the far right had a sign indicating that we should go to the left of it; the centre lane was full of rowing boats; the far left lane seemed to be free. So, not wishing to get in the way of the early morning rowing practice, we headed for the far left. After much yelling from a coxswain we realised we were supposed to go down the middle lane. The narrow boat equivalent of an emergency stop is a painfully slow and embarrassing half-pirouette which we performed mid-river with a large audience of rowers...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n47/P1240653.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Liberty Bell passing a team of rowers&quot; /&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Our next obstacle, a swimmer!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We set off for Marlow, keeping an eye open for Chris and Sara who were planning to go canoeing on the river there, but we didn't see them. When we arrived the only mooring space available was half the size we needed but we managed to moor Liberty Belle's rear end properly and tie her bow to a tree. The indignity of it all!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Off we went for a walk uphill, hoping to find the viewpoint indicated on the map and get some photos of the river from above. Sadly the trees were too high and obscured the view. We did, however, find an elephant lurking amongst the bins behind some houses on the hill, so the climb wasn't wasted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During our stay in Marlow there was a food and music festival called ' The Pub in the Park'. After our climb we decided to sit on a bench outside the festival and listen to the music (it was much too expensive to go in...). Unfortunately we chose to do this during the hour when the daytime visitors were leaving and the ground was being prepared for the evening crowd, so no music. We returned to the boat and watched the acrobatics of a tern instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;An elephant.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our next mooring was in Maidenhead where we could stay for 24 hours for £8. We were beginning to get used to paying. There was plenty of room so we decided to moor alongside some convenient steps and Tony went off to pay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n47/P5211712.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A 'Passenger Boat Moorings' sign on the wall beside the river&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Surely these two signs are no longer relevant....&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n47/P5211708.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Another 'Passenger Boat Moorings' sign on the wall beside the river&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n47/P5211709.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A more recent '24hr Moorings charge £8' sign on the wall beside the river&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;... and have been superseded by the sign that has been attached to the wall between them...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had intended to stop off at Cookham village on the way to Maidenhead but it would have cost us £8 to moor for a brief look around. Now that we were safely moored we decided to walk back there instead. It was a lovely walk and we treated ourselves to a cream tea there before walking back via the delightful Ray Mill Island park, with its aviary and cage of busy guinea pigs (as well as very nice ice-cream....).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

which shows an aerial view of the village.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After dinner we wandered into Maidenhead town which was a bit confused in its layout and rather a disappointment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so to bed....briefly!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suddenly there were bright lights outside the porthole and the sound of people calling to each other, followed by a loud hooting noise. I peeped out and saw the hull of a huge boat right outside the window. Crikey. We hurriedly got dressed and went outside to find a large trip boat trying to moor up exactly where we were! Double crikey!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The crew were very patient with us and helped to move Liberty Belle a few feet along the landing stage and re-moor us. That done, they unloaded their passengers up the steps and went on their way.
Full of adrenaline, we tried to get to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Windsor was next! £10 a night to moor there (despite a lack of mooring rings), which was collected remarkably promptly! I have always wanted to explore Windsor and it didn't disappoint. The beautiful weather helped too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;No! Really? Good grief.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Windsor we went to Kingston-upon-Thames, arriving there quite late in the day. We were a little concerned about the possibility of mooring but we shouldn't have worried as there was plenty of room and it was free for 24 hours! We did however have to register our boat on a website which Tony couldn't get to work.....it turned out that the site was usable on a phone but not on a laptop. Please test your software before insisting that people use it and threatening them with a fine...grrrr.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, during these few days, Tony had been worrying about getting through the tidal lock on the Thames. But that's another story!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rachel Glombek</name></author><summary type="html">From Newbury to Kingston-Upon-Thames 15th - 22nd May 2019</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Many Hands…</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/libertybellenewsletter/2019/05/28/many-hands.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Many Hands..." /><published>2019-05-28T09:12:00+01:00</published><updated>2019-05-28T09:12:00+01:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/libertybellenewsletter/2019/05/28/many-hands</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/libertybellenewsletter/2019/05/28/many-hands.html">&lt;h2&gt;From Bradford-on-Avon to Newbury&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;9th - 14th May 2019&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Our route&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Gongoozling Calves&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to keep ourselves informed about the closure of locks on our way, we have signed up for automatic information emails from the Canal &amp;amp; River Trust (we receive several a day).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A recent email had informed us about a widebeam boat caught in a lock that was too narrow for it. It took some time to release the boat, by which time there was quite a queue of boats waiting to pass through. This lock was some way ahead of us at the time and the drama was all over before we reached the area. However, as soon as we did arrive at the lock, it was obvious that it was the one involved! Layers of brick had been removed from the sides of the exit. What a mess!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n46/P5091458.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;2&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The warning on the lock arm suggests boats should leave one at a time (so that they don't get wedged against the walls) but a widebeam is a single boat of double width, so no chance of that.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n46/P5091457.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;3&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The brick sides of the exit have been removed. It must have been very difficult with the boat wedged in situ. Goodness knows what state the boat's paintwork is in...!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We left Bradford-on-Avon with the hope of getting to Newbury by 14th May to catch up with John and Viv. During the day we were lucky enough to team up with another boat, making the locks easier. This was a hire boat, crewed by two friends that both happened to have 'Holiday on a Canal Boat' on their bucket-lists, so they had decided to go together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The time passed pleasantly, chatting with the woman as we worked the locks together. I asked her whether she planned to holiday on a boat again sometime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;No.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She seemed quite definite!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We finally managed to moor for lunch at 4pm at the bottom of the Caen Hill locks, having forfeited another meal!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n46/IMG_20190509_081541_cropped.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;4&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;A duck looking through our side hatch, hoping for breakfast!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At breakfast the following morning, a boat passed us, approaching the first of the day's 29 locks. We dashed outside to ask if they would consider waiting a couple of minutes so that we could partner with them. They agreed so we hurriedly got ready and set off. We were definitely in luck. The weather was sunny, our lock partners were friendly, good company and plentiful!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The boat belonged to a couple who were setting off for a 3 month adventure and were accompanied by friends and family to see them on their way. The helmsmen practised moving out of one lock and into the next together, side-by-side, instead of moving one at a time, which worked very well. With the help of all these lovely people we got through the Caen Hill flight of locks before lunch! Our partners moored up beside a pub, and we carried on to do the last couple of locks on our own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; As we completed the last lock we were lucky enough to witness a boat leaving a mooring in front of us and we were able to slip Liberty Belle straight into the space. This gave us plenty of time to visit the local launderette, have tea and cake then explore the shops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n46/P5101470.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;5&quot; /&gt;

 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n46/P5101463.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;6&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Synchronised boating.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following morning, after cruising for a while, I suddenly realised that I had left my windlass in Devizes... Oh no! This was the one Tony had bought for me at the beginning of our adventure, so it was a sad loss. We do, however, have several spares, so not a disaster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did some of the steering and felt confident enough to think I could control Liberty Belle in front of a swing bridge and let Tony step off to open it. Well, I didn't quite hit the moored boats nor did I actually bash into the side of the bridge, but for the next swing bridge, I tied Liberty Belle up until I could steer straight through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n46/P5111495.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;7&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Steering for a change...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later, as Tony was guiding Liberty Belle past some moored boats, a widebeam boat called Rachel came into view, heading in the opposite direction. Tony moved over slightly and there was plenty of room. We were just joking about Rachels being broad in the beam when she suddenly started heading straight for us! We had nowhere to go to get out of the way and she rammed us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course we were then in danger of hitting the moored boats, so I tried to fend them off whilst Tony tried to steer us out of trouble. There was no apology or even eye contact from Rachel's crew! Flippin' 'eck! Don't insult Rachels. Just don't.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n46/P5111483.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;8&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;'Rachel' just before she headed straight for us.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We moored up briefly at the water tap outside The Barge Inn at Honeystreet and were told that it would be opening on 24th May, and asked to spread the word. Consider it done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n46/IMG-20190511-WA0000.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;9&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The Barge in Honeystreet has changed hands and been closed for quite some time for refurbishment. At the time of writing this newsletter, it should be open.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Continuing on our way we saw our first cygnets of the year and glimpsed our first bluebells through the trees. We were also seen off by a brave swan who escorted us to the edge of his territory. He seemed quite proud that he had seen off such a large creature. Well done Mr. Swan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n46/P5111484.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;10&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Okay, okay Mr. Swan, we're leaving as fast as we can!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n46/P5111481.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;11&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Congratulations on your brood, Mrs. Swan!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later in the day we teamed up with a loan boater, Andy, to do the locks. He works for a marina, moving boats around the network. It seems that his work is a bit hit-and-miss but he has been working 7 days a week most weeks since Christmas. He tries to get as many miles done as he can each day but it is very hard work without crew so he likes to share the locks whenever possible. He was friendly and chatty and the partnership worked well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a lovely day full of cuckoos, swallows, kingfishers, red kites (often being mobbed by other birds), ducklings, goslings, cygnets, and wagtails nesting in the locks gates. The canal was covered in a white carpet of downy willow tree seed 'fluff'. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As evening approached we found a single mooring space so we shared it with Andy by tying the two boats side by side. We agreed to set off early the next morning and continue our partnership. Andy explained that the Kennet &amp;amp; Avon is so low on water for the time of year that it is in danger of being closed so we should get outta here. Enough said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next morning we set off as planned and completed our journey to Hungerford in very good time. We moored there for the night and Andy carried on, he had more to do than us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Hungerford, we shared locks with a boat called Matilda and her husband &amp;amp; wife crew. We moored in Newbury, one behind the other, in the perfect place, pretty and centrally located. We had a little look around and found ourselves in a canalside cafe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John and Viv managed to find us the following day and we explored Newbury with our guests. Yet again we were lucky with the weather and had a delightful day.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Sunshine above and below&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After leaving Bath we, (Tony, Mary and myself), decided it would be nice to moor up near to the Dundas Aqueduct and take a stroll across it before visiting the nearby village of Monkton Coombe. Having checked our map to find the number of the bridge nearest to the aqueduct, we travelled along until we reached that bridge and moored nearby.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We set off for our walk. We walked on... and on... much further than we had expected. It turned out that the bridges on the map had been incorrectly numbered! Good grief.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n45/P5031367.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;2&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;A boat called Brexit (partially sunk)&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;We first saw this boat when several Europeans, (Germans, I think), were posing in front of it, laughing and taking photos...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally we arrived at the aqueduct, shook off the Canal &amp;amp; River Trust chappy (who wanted us to donate on a monthly basis) and walked into Monkton Coombe for a little look around. We then had a nice big lunch to prepare us for the walk back...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Lunch&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the up side, we were moored closer to the historic Claverton Pumping Station than we had expected and the volunteers were going to be running it whilst we were there, so the next morning we set off to investigate. After an interesting look around we were about to leave when we were offered a guided tour. The young man that guided us made it all even more fascinating, so it was well worth the visit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pump was built to feed water from the river into the canal above. It is driven by a water wheel, rotated by the flow of the river. Unfortunately, the water cannot now be pumped into the canal because the modern pumping station uses the same pipes and cannot be disrupted. This means the pumped water is piped back into the river, behind the wheel, which gives the impression of the station &quot;lifting itself up by its own boot straps&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst we were here, Mary spotted a fox running alongside the canal, so we were able to add him to our list of wildlife spotted on our journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n45/P5041385.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;5&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Claverton Pumping Station which recently became a Grade 1 listed building.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We cruised along, finally reaching the Dundas Aqueduct where we stopped to take on water. Suddenly there was a great kerfuffle in a nearby hedge. A woman passing by investigated and tried to intervene. Tony too, went to have a look. A magpie was being ineffectually attacked by a pair of blackbirds as it ate the contents of their nest. The woman trying to 'shoo' it away didn't have any effect either. I know it's just nature, but I am glad I didn't witness it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On that sad note, we crossed this aqueduct and moored just before the next one at Avoncliff. We had a quick look around and decided we would have a better look and a pub lunch the following day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The view from the Avoncliff Aqueduct.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it turned out, Tony went for an early walk the next morning to look at the mooring possibilities in Bradford-on-Avon and came back full of enthusiasm for moving on because there were a couple of spaces in a prime position, so Avoncliff's delights would have to wait for another visit...
(We did, however, get our pub lunch, in Bradford-on-Avon.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We took Mary for a look around the town, including the Tithe Barn and three very different churches. One Norman church (laid out very much in the way we expect and visited by us on our first visit to Bradford-on-Avon), one fascinating Saxon church (nothing like any others we have seen) and one which had been built as a town hall originally, rejected by the town, adopted by the Catholic church and looking very much like a town hall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n45/P5051434.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;8&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;A 14th century barn in Bradford on Avon, which, despite probably not being used for collecting tithes, is called The Tithe Barn.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n45/P5051454.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;9&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The use of the Saxon Church in Bradford on Avon is not in doubt but its age is. It was built somewhere between the 8th and the 11th century. What's 300 years between friends?&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following day we had visitors! Claire and Keith came to meet Liberty Belle and have a look around Bradford-on-Avon. The weather did us proud so they were able to see the town at it's best. We visited the Bradford-on-Avon Millennium Embroidery, the Iron Duke Rubber Roller (or Calendar, confusingly), the reconstructed old Chemist shop in the museum (exactly like the one Mary used to work in), and the Secret Garden Cafe for you-know-what. After a lovely day they set off for home, taking Tony with them!

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Mary back in a Chemist shop, surrounded by familiar equipment, fittings and stock.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whist Tony was at the house, weeding the drive, Mary and I had a final look around Bradford-on-Avon and a pub lunch (this is becoming a habit!) before Mary caught her train home. I was suddenly alone...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The weather was still sunny so I decided not to waste it and went for a walk to Avoncliff, to see what we had missed. Well, nothing, as it turned out!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to walk back on a footpath along the river, next to the canal. It was all very lovely with the added excitement of a living-willow labyrinth and a pond, teeming with tadpoles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wednesday's weather was in complete contrast, with rain, hail and thunderstorms. Tony gave up gardening and took the train back to Liberty Belle where we sat out the bad weather, planning our next move...&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Another beautiful day.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 24th April is Tony’s birthday! After opening his card (not from me, you understand) and hanging it up, we moved Liberty Belle nearer to Bath Spa station and went food shopping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By 11:30 we were waiting at the station for Mary to arrive. We had 2 exits covered but she came out at the third! She nearly went to Leamington Spa, (we are still not sure whether it was her mistake or that of the ticket office) so it could have been worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My cousin, Robyn, caught up with us in the afternoon so we had a long chat, a cuppa and a stroll to take in the views. We all agreed that she lives in a lovely city!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n44/P4241154.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;3&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;On both visits to Bath, Liberty Belle spent some time moored next to this sundial. If the sun was shining, we could see what time it was...Oh well, we'll call it lunch time, just in case.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following morning, Rose joined us for second breakfast. After opening his second birthday card and hanging it up, we all set off for Keynsham. Rose volunteered to help me fight with some of the locks which sped up the proceedings, particularly for the deep lock in Bath.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along the way we attempted to tie up outside one of the Canal &amp;amp; River Trust facilities moorings, which was tricky due to certain boats being permanently moored there....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along the canals, the Canal &amp;amp; River Trust provide certain facilities for boaters. These consist of one or more of the following:- a water tap; elsan disposal; toilet tank pump out; toilets; rubbish bins; recycling facilities (rare); showers (very rare). Boats should only moor at these facilities for the short time it takes to use them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In areas where people are likely to want to stay, near shops and pubs, visitor moorings are provided which are restricted to a specified number of days. As there are very few of them on the Kennet &amp;amp; Avon, these moorings are usually restricted to 1 or 2 days. It is very difficult to moor alongside the towpath on this canal because the boats become grounded before they are close enough to the edge for the crew to alight. As a consequence of this, many of the visitor moorings (and even facilities moorings) have been adopted as permanent moorings, disregarding the restrictions. This is very frustrating....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we travelled along Rose was able to point out beauty and colours where I only saw rusty bridges and dilapidated walls... This journey is wasted on me. Maybe someone should write a Rose App that enables you to film things as you go along and points out how beautiful it all is. Or maybe I should just learn to observe...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We kept our eyes peeled for a lunch time mooring but found nothing until Keynsham, at about 3pm, where we took the last remaining visitor mooring. Rose had to leave us there and catch a train home, a little later than she had planned. Thank you, Rose, for a lovely day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n44/P4251165.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;4&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Bath Deep Lock&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Just look at the height of those gates! They are so heavy that they are opened &amp;amp; closed using a winding mechanism, not pushed like the others. This seems to take forever....&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Bath Deep Lock is the second deepest lock in the country at 19ft 5ins (we didn't measure it ourselves...). It has the combined depth of the two locks that it replaced during the restoration of the canal in 1976. A road was built over the original site of one of those locks.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bristol Harbour is tidal, so, before entering the harbour, it is necessary to contact the Harbour Master or the keeper of the tidal lock to get permission to continue. Tony attempted several times to book our passage through the lock into the harbour. When he finally managed to get through, he informed them that one of their numbers didn't seem to work at all. The lock keeper was surprised that the number was still being given out as it belonged to a phone that had fallen into the lock a year ago... Well, no wonder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lock itself had been left open but we needed to stop and buy our Bristol Harbour licence. We tied up, making sure we avoided a pole sticking out horizontally from the pontoon looking all the world like an eye-poker-outer. It turned out that the pole had been put there at the same height as the lowest bridge in the harbour to indicate whether we would fit under it or not. It was going to be a tight squeeze, but it wouldn't need to be lifted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With our 3 day licence, some indication of where we could moor and the advice to 'navigate the bridges as best you know', off we went.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we got closer the rain poured down in torrents. We contacted Cathy and she confirmed that there was mooring space outside the 'Vegetable Diva', where she works. Hurray!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we tried to moor the wind picked up and kept Liberty Belle pinned against the end of one of the pontoon 'fingers' that we were trying to swing past. The lady operating the ferry took pity on us, stood on the end of the 'finger' and heaved Liberty Belle past it and into our mooring. Well done and many thanks to her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cathy, who was just finishing her break, saw us arrive and rushed out to greet us but had to immediately return to work.  As it was getting late we stopped to have lunch on the boat before visiting Cathy at her place of work for a coffee. We immediately realised that we should have saved ourselves for something from the cafe because the savoury treats looked absolutely wonderful. I was determined that we would buy some of them the following day. After finishing work Cathy joined us on Liberty Belle for the evening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Hello Bristol!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The wind only got worse overnight. As the waves thrashed against the side of the boat, it sounded like an ogre was tramping up and down on the roof, moaning and groaning… Mary got up a couple of times in the night to check that we weren’t untied and floating off out to sea!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n44/IMG-20190427-WA0007.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;7&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Waves slapping about at our mooring.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite all the noise, we got through the night unscathed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the morning Cathy and Will escorted us as we were blown around Bristol for the day, dodging in and out of museums, shops and cafes. Joe managed to track us down and joined us for lunch, making 6 of us, quite a family gathering! This could have been tricky in Mokoko, but we managed to commandeer the only table large enough for us in the cafe - Cathy and I can look quite threatening when necessary! Later we all returned to Liberty Belle for the evening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following morning the weather was comparatively calm. There were several rowing teams out on the water. Joe joined us for the morning for a coffee in Pinkmans and a look around the excellent Bristol Museum and Art Gallery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will joined us for lunch at the Christmas Steps pub, after which Joe set off for home and we, (Tony, Mary and myself) set off for the SS Great Britain. We found plenty to interest us en route and by the time we arrived it was almost time for Cathy to finish work. We got straight onto the ferry back to Liberty Belle and I rushed to buy a few yummy things for tea time from her in the ‘Vegetable Diva’. Soon afterwards Cathy arrived with more nice things to eat, shortly followed by Will with even more goodies, so we shared a delicious feast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the Monday morning Cathy returned to Liberty Belle and became our helmsman for a couple of days. We had planned to moor at Keynsham the first night but there was no space for us so we had to carry on all the way to Bath where we moored on the river. Well done Cathy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The Kennet and Avon is partly river and partly canal bypassing unnavigable parts of the river. A weir accompanies each lock on the canal stretches allowing surplus water to flow into the nearby river.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;No, we haven't taken a wrong turn and ended up in the Everglades but we have found a turtle! (Cathy gets the prize for spotting him)&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We wandered around Bath, taking in the sights, including the Abbey and covered market. We ate excellent pies in The Raven at lunch time, then, in the afternoon, Cathy took Liberty Belle through the 3 locks to the mooring space we had used the the week before. During the evening Cathy had to leave us and caught the train back to Bristol.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mary, Tony and I joined a free walking tour of Bath, available every day and worth every penny! We had a very pleasant and knowledgeable guide who kept us interested for over 2 hours. In the afternoon, Tony and I left Mary on Liberty Belle, reading her book, whilst we went for a walk uphill to get some views of Bath. We do like this city and are already planning to return (probably by train to avoid cruising back through Reading...).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the success of Wednesday's tour we decided to stay for another day and join a different tour, which was also interesting. Feeling that we had now seen some of Bath and maybe learnt a little bit about it, we set off in the afternoon. Before long the weather turned and we got soaked to the skin! We moored up as soon as we found a space, because we couldn’t take any more. We found ourselves in Bathampton for the night, just 2 miles and 3 locks away from our Bath mooring. Oh well!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rachel Glombek</name></author><summary type="html">Bath to Bristol and Back Again (via the Everglades) 24th April - 1st May 2019</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Bath Time</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/libertybellenewsletter/2019/05/10/bath-time.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Bath Time" /><published>2019-05-10T09:04:00+01:00</published><updated>2019-05-10T09:04:00+01:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/libertybellenewsletter/2019/05/10/bath-time</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/libertybellenewsletter/2019/05/10/bath-time.html">&lt;h2&gt;Woolhampton to Bath&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;16th - 23rd April 2019&lt;/h2&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We left Woolhampton full of trepidation, wondering what the Kennet and Avon would throw at us next. It turned out to be a confused electronically operated swing bridge. Having waited for the pedestrians on the towpath to cross over the bridge, I pressed the appropriate buttons to lower the barriers and start the swinging process. Before it had opened enough to let Liberty Belle go through, it stopped. According to a passer-by, it had been fixed the day before... By now, more pedestrians were gathering on the towpath, waiting to cross and Tony was wondering what was taking so long. I pressed the button required to swing the bridge back across the canal and there was some movement, which was encouraging. Tony tied Liberty Belle up and came to investigate. I allowed the bridge to shut again and re-started the process. This time the bridge behaved exactly as it should, opening wide to allow Tony to guide Liberty Belle through. It also closed perfectly and we were off again. Phew.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We passed through Newbury, where we should have been moored back in February for my Mum's birthday - just a bit late. There, we teamed up with another boat, a hire boat with a crew of 10, covering 3 generations of a family, and worked the locks together. We had a short delay, (OK, a long delay), when one of their crew threw the rope from the boat in the direction of a waiting crew member on the tow path, and the rope fell in the water. There was a terrible sound as the rope wrapped itself many, many times around the propeller.  Liberty Belle was waiting in the lock for the other boat to join her. After a while, two more boats arrived and tied up patiently. Just as we were about to give the lock to these newcomers there was a cheer and the offending rope was held aloft. We were off!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Kintbury we managed to squeeze into the last available mooring. It could have been argued that we were partially blocking the bridge so we planned an early start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Our mooring for the night. Liberty Belle just squeezed in before the bridge. Note the ambitious gradient of the railway track on the side of the bridge.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We managed to set off before anyone had time to complain about our mooring. Entering a lock we noticed a boat following behind us so we waited for them to catch up. A young man, jogging along the towpath, stopped to help at the lock by opening the second gate. I thanked him. I was a little surprised that he should stop his jog for us. He explained that he was holidaying on the approaching boat and was a little put out that they had set off whilst he was on his run....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There appeared to be two other young people on the boat but as we all waited for the lock to fill, several more young people gradually emerged, buttoning up their clothes, or eating cereal, or cleaning their teeth…. Obviously two of the crew were much too impatient to wait for the others to be ready. We shared the locks with them until they turned around just before Hungerford.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After lunch and a quick look around the town we teamed up with another boat, 'First Light', owned by Colin and Julie who are on the same adventure as us! This is the first couple we have met that are continuous cruisers planning to complete the whole network. Obviously we had a lot to chat about. Our first encounter together was a collapsed swing bridge, crawling with Canal &amp;amp; River Trust people rapidly repairing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, out of nowhere, Beckie and Buddy appeared! It was an amazing surprise. They were able to join us on board for a little while until we arrived at the bridge where Beckie had left her car.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Great Bedwyn, First Light moored up and we said goodbye to Colin &amp;amp; Julie. We continued on to our mooring for the night, alongside a field of delightful pigs who ignored us completely. I briefly thought we had a very different neighbour in another field - a large kind of deer or elk. I was very excited! However, when it lifted it’s head, its antlers remained on the floor, now looking like a fallen branch. The strange creature was a donkey. I do like donkeys but it was still a bit of a disappointment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n43/P4170988.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;5&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Surprise visitors!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After checking on the pigs, (fast asleep in a bundled heap in their cosy house), we set off through 10 locks and a tunnel. The tunnel was short and we were able to see a heron framed in the circle made by the far end of the tunnel and it’s reflection. It was a beautiful sight, gradually becoming closer and closer. Just as we were about to emerge from the tunnel I tried to take a photo of the heron but, of course, it flew away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We arrived at Honeystreet and were able to moor up directly outside the Barge Inn. The perfect mooring! I have always wanted to moor there. Unfortunately the pub was closed for refurbishment. No wonder the mooring was available. Hmm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Robin joined us there and, to make up for our disappointment at finding the pub closed, he drove us to another pub and bought us dinner. What made it even more delightful was the pub parrot. He didn’t speak to us at all on the way in, but as we left he clearly said&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Goodbye. Thankyou.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fabulous!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n43/P4181007.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;6&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Good luck Mrs Swan.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;A very cute boat.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following morning we waited in Honeystreet for the Devizes to Westminster canoe race to pass by. We had no desire to get muddled up in that. Whilst we waited we all got some jobs done. Once it was clear, Robin drove off to park his car in Devizes and we set off in Liberty Belle. Robin cycled back along the towpath and met us at a swing bridge where he and his bike boarded Liberty Belle and we arrived in Devizes together where we met up with the Bradshaws and Julie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Julie &amp;amp; Robin as extra crew members we flew down the Caen Hill locks, fuelled by ice cream, tea &amp;amp; biscuits and lager, in that order. After a well deserved lunch, Robin and Julie each went on their way. We sat in the shade on the towpath and enjoyed a relaxing cuppa. Later Joe joined us on his way home from a road trip to Scotland and the Lakes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Still going after all those locks!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next morning Joe crewed with us for a while before returning to his van and heading home. We continued on to Bradford-on-Avon, where we shared the last lock with a hire boat. The boat was a long one and the stern of the boat was subjected to a lot of water spray whilst in the lock. Tony felt sorry for the woman at the helm and let her out of the lock first, despite the concern that she might take the best mooring space! Fortunately, her boat was too long to fit into the space we wanted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a stroll around Bradford-on-Avon we bumped into a woman from the boat we shared the Caen Hill locks with the day before, which was nice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n43/P4211068.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;11&quot; /&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a short stay in the delightful Bradford-on-Avon we set off for Bath. The countryside was beautiful. There were lots of boats to see on the way, in varying states of repair (or dis-repair). We moored on the outskirts of Bath, just before Sydney gardens then went for a stroll to see if there were any other moorings available nearer the railway station. We were due to meet Mary off her train the next day. Having found what we wanted, we had a quick look around Bath and decided we like it.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Passing through Somerton Deep Lock again, this time with blooming Forsythia&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we returned to Liberty Belle, waiting for us in Banbury, we had plans....Reading by Friday, (to meet Robin and Julie), then Bath by Easter! Hahaha!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First we had to give Liberty Belle a service with the help of Bill the Engineer. This took flippin’ hours but a proper job was done. So, later than expected, at 14:30, we left Banbury and tried to get to Aynho Wharf for fuel before they closed.... It was slow going, especially when we tried to fill Aynho Weir Lock. The previous users had left one of the paddles up slightly, allowing the lock to leak and preventing it from filling completely.... Grrr...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were nearly there, hoping that they would still be open at 18:00 when we were likely to arrive, when we met a chap that informed us that they closed at 15:30 at this time of year. Oh flip! We now had to moor there overnight so that we could refuel when they opened at 9 am. This meant that we hadn’t done as many miles as we had hoped and we wouldn’t get the early start we needed the next day. Already things were not going to plan....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After this set back, the revised plan is to get to Oxford by Friday, which is far more achievable.
Once we had a tank full of fuel we set off from Aynho. As we were coming into Somerton Tony noticed someone walking along the towpath towards us who looked like Neil and walked like Neil. It turned out to BE Neil! It seems he wasn't in Spain, as we had thought! Once we had managed to get him on board and found a mooring space we stopped for a cuppa and a slice of cake, kindly provided by our surprise guest. It was only a short visit as he was on his way North. He left us with the remains of the cake and walked the few yards back to his car. (We had finished the cake before he drove off....)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later in the day we had a slightly traumatic experience when coming alongside the towpath to let me off for a lock. We almost trapped a duck and her ducklings! Mother duck knew to race along to the rear of the boat but the ducklings swam in confused circles with Liberty Belle giving them less and less room! Mother duck was quacking and encouraging them to follow her and they where chirping and darting about in all directions! At the last minute Mother duck managed to get her message across and all were safe... Phew.
We collected water from Thrupp and moored there for the night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n42/P4100848.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;2&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Don't forget me!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On leaving Thrupp  it was an easy trip into Oxford where we found a mooring quite near the Isis lock, the last one before the Thames. We went for a look around Oxford then cooked a curry ready for the weekend visitors. In the evening we went for a short walk in the hope of seeing some otters but were not in luck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;A raft used to monitor otter population. How exciting!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After getting the boat ready for our guests we went into Oxford for a snack in the Handlebar Cafe, which was delightful, then a look around the fascinating and utterly wonderful Pitt Rivers museum. Neil popped by to see us again on his way back South and we all went to collect Julie &amp;amp; Robin from the station before heading to Wetherspoons (Four Candles) for a meal. Robin had misunderstood the situation, thinking we would be travelling from Oxford to Reading in one day and had only paid for his car to stay in the Reading car park for 24 hours, so we spent some time downloading an App that would enable him to pay remotely for an extra day’s parking. Julie was trapped for a day longer than she had planned...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neil headed back to his car and the rest of us started our weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We began Saturday with a big breakfast and then set off onto the Thames. The river was not as wide there as we had anticipated, nor as busy. There were, however, a lot of rowing boats, which we somehow managed to avoid. All the locks were operated by push-button controls and most of them were manned by lock-keepers, so the going was easy. We completed about half of the trip between Oxford and Reading before mooring for the night alongside a slightly rough river's edge with trees and nettles at Shillingford bridge. We avoided the moorings next to the bridge as they were very smart and bound to be pricey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Our beautiful mooring space that we initially assumed was free...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early on Sunday morning, we began to suspect that our mooring place wasn’t free, as we had assumed, so we left hastily before someone charged us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we turned the corner, leaving the River Thames at Reading, I seem to remember seeing a friendly sign saying &quot;Welcome to the Kennet and Avon Canal&quot;.... Hmmm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The water was shallow and we struggled to manoeuvre. When we found somewhere to stop, to allow Robin &amp;amp; Julie to disembark, there was a sign with rather small writing. Having tied Liberty Belle up, we approached the sign and managed to read that, by stopping there, we now owed the 'up to 4 hours' fee of £4. If we stayed overnight we would owe £9:50. We were also informed that we had now been caught on CCTV and a failure to pay would result in a fine of £100. These moorings are owned by the council, offer no facilities except mooring rings and are not even secure. Robin and Julie disembarked and headed for Robin’s car whilst we moved Liberty Belle on with Tony muttering &quot;Just let them try...&quot; and immediately getting grounded on the corner. A bit of to-and-fro, back-and-forth and we were free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We travelled through the centre of Reading (no moorings here at all) before coming to a narrow stretch where traffic lights were in use to prevent boats from meeting head on. Boaters are expected to press a button, pedestrian crossing style, on the right hand side of the canal and wait up to 12 minutes for a green light. There is nowhere to tie up, nowhere to allow a crew member to step off the boat, so Tony had to try and swing Liberty Belle within reach of the button with me leaning over to press it. The light went green straight away so we avoided having to decide how to stay put for up to 12 minutes....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We thought this was tricky but it was nothing compared to the next 2 locks. Liberty Belle had to choose between obeying Tony and being swept away by the river rushing past the lock. Luckily, Tony won. If there had been any rain recently, the ending may have been different. We helped ourselves to a map of the Kennet and Avon, chuckling at the obvious error on the map. There was a symbol in the map’s key for mooring and it hadn’t been used on the map until Bath. Not so funny really, as it turned out… In reality, there are mooring spaces, but they are generally few and far between. If you want to stop alongside the towpath, which we have done many times on other canals, you risk coming aground before you are close enough to jump off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the second lock, where the river gives way to the man made canal, the mooring posts were well ahead of the lock due to the river rushing around and in front of the lock gates. The strong wind pushed us against the mooring which was handy for me to get off but tricky for Tony to get away and pick up enough speed to get through the river flow and into the lock. Once in, the flow of the water when the lock was filling was so crazy that I could only open the paddle a tiny amount before it got too tricky to control the boat. Unfortunately the water was leaking out of the bottom gates almost as quickly as it was flowing in through the paddle. Slowly Liberty Belle began to rise but became out of control so I dropped the paddle  to allow Tony to get control again. The filling of this lock took ages and it was all very stressful. &quot;Welcome to the Kennet and Avon&quot;. Yeah, right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the top of the lock was a different world of calm. Finally we were able to leave the lock and moor behind the other boats in the tranquil canal. We were exhausted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;When the lock gates are open just make a mad dash at the lock, trying not to let the water push you away...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the following day every lock had a nasty surprise and they were interspersed with lift bridges. Most of the bridges were electric, the traffic controlled by lights and barriers which are operated by buttons on a console. In order for the controls to work, a British Waterways Key needs to be turned in the keyhole and is only released when the bridge has been replaced. As we approached one particular bridge it became apparent that someone had already lifted it. The boat passing under the bridge had a single crew member so his key had been left in the control panel. Following him in quick succession were two other boats, each with a one-man crew. With a few shouted messages it became apparent that the helmsman of the third one was charged with retrieving the keys. He waited just beyond the bridge for us to pass under and for me to lower the bridge before he collected the key. It all went very smoothly. However, the van driver waiting for the bridge to be returned did not respond to my wave of thanks for being patient. Presumably because he wasn’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At about 4 o’clock we decided to give up finding a sensible place to moor for lunch and tie Liberty Belle to a couple of trees. I managed to jump from the bow onto a firm piece of land and wrap the rope around a tree as Tony nudged it with Liberty Belle's nose. Tony then brought the back end in and jumped, trusting that he would land with his feet on firm ground... He was just trying to secure the stern rope to the second tree when a passer by stopped and told us about some proper moorings just a few minutes away, beyond the next lock. I released the front and Tony returned the stern rope. Being a gentleman he allowed me to step aboard before him and got left behind on the towpath as Liberty Belle was swept to the other side of the river. I grabbed the tiller and managed to steer her back over without getting grounded... Golly.
By the time we had operated another lift bridge (with another impatient van driver) and charged Liberty Belle through the flow of the river across the front of the lock and through the lock gates, waited for the volunteers (bless their cotton socks) to refill the lock and release us, another hour had gone by. One of the lock keepers said he suspected that one of the moored boats at the top of the lock was about to leave and thus give us a space to moor. He went ahead of us and confirmed that this was the case. Thank you kind man! Phew. Lunch time at last!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Note: as we had lunch so late, we didn't have an evening meal. Tony has pointed out, on a regular basis ever since, that he has missed an entire meal.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;18th March - 7th April 2019&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dear All, sorry we haven't been in touch lately, we have had long cruising days. At last we have had a break for a day, so I have found some time to catch up on newsletters...here's one for a month ago!&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;It's another long day&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Monday 18th March, after walking around a lake in Loughborough, doing a spot of bird-watching, (coot, mallard, wigeon, tufted duck, gadwell and swans) we received an email from the Canal &amp;amp; River Trust informing us that the River Soar was now open. We could go! It was too late to set off straight away so we got ourselves ready to set off first thing in the morning. Meanwhile, Joe contacted us and we arranged to meet at the weekend at Napton junction, so there was no time to waste!
As soon as we set off our spirits lifted. We didn't even stop for tea breaks or lunch, making pots of tea and sandwiches as we 'sped' along!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n41/P3190579.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;2&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;A pair of heron.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At a lock on the outskirts of Leicester we met two young lads magnet fishing who seemed delighted to see us, immediately abandoning their pastime for the new one of bombarding Tony and myself with questions!  Actually, there weren't many questions but each one was repeated many times. In their attempt to help us with the lock they managed to get in the way in every possible manner, giving me reason to be anxious by walking across the lock gates without holding on. I found myself trying to find several different ways to explain why one set of gates could open whilst those at the opposite end wouldn't, whilst Tony tried to explain how he managed without being on any kind of benefit, what a licence is and the concept of a pension. Finally, we managed to move out of the lock. As a parting gesture one of the young gentlemen asked if he could have a pound for helping, so I explained to him that he owed us far more than that for entertaining them, after which they quickly returned to their magnet fishing...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After taking 9 hours to travel 15 miles and complete 11 locks we arrived at the secure moorings to find no space there for us, so we chained &amp;amp; padlocked Liberty Belle to the towpath and settled ourselves down for the night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Sharing the water in Leicester with rowers and swans.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We cruised along in this way for the next couple days, admiring the blackthorn blossom, the fresh hawthorn leaves, the cheerful celandine and violet flowers. Spring is definitely on its way, we even saw a pair of kingfishers and a pair of heron! There were also a few more boats around now that the season was changing.
We arrived back at the bottom of the Foxton flight of locks where Tony went to arrange our passage up whilst I gave some Australians a tour of Liberty Belle. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When our turn came, I took the helm and Tony did the locking. He didn't have much help from the volunteer lock keepers as they were busy trying to fish an American boater's mobile phone out from one of the top locks...&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Do you remember me mentioning the elm trees planted alongside the canal as 'Living Milestones' in a previous newsletter? Well, I remembered to take a photo of a marker put in the place of one of the trees. Not a thing of beauty in itself....&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day we arrived at the Watford flight of Locks where we were also allowed to make our way down without supervision. We obviously look the part now. Oh Heck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We reached Norton junction on Friday afternoon, ready to meet up with Joe with his new purchase, ‘Suzanne the Nissan van’. We spent the weekend helping him with the conversion of Suzanne into a camper - insulation, leisure battery, pull-out bed….all sorts! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;A well earned tea break.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joe left us on Sunday evening, after a very busy weekend, but we arranged to meet him back at the house on the following Thursday, to carry on the good work with Suzanne. First we had to get Liberty Belle to a 14 day mooring in Banbury (again), so we spent the next few days getting there as fast as we could.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the first evening we decided to moor up in Napton near The Folly, so that we could go into this excellent pub for an evening pint. We were disappointed to find it closed!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We managed to get into Banbury on the Wednesday, so we moored up and went back to the house a whole day early!
With Suzanne parked in our driveway we continued to work on her for a week or so, in preparation for Joe and Kirsty to take her to Scotland. Oh, and we did some very urgent gardening…!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rachel Glombek</name></author><summary type="html">From Loughborough to Banbury 18th March - 7th April 2019</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Learning to Love Loughborough</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/libertybellenewsletter/2019/03/17/learning-to-love-loughborough.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Learning to Love Loughborough" /><published>2019-03-17T16:40:00+00:00</published><updated>2019-03-17T16:40:00+00:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/libertybellenewsletter/2019/03/17/learning-to-love-loughborough</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/libertybellenewsletter/2019/03/17/learning-to-love-loughborough.html">&lt;h2&gt;Hanging Around Again!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;6th - 16th March 2019&lt;/h2&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Liberty Belle being dwarfed by a working boat.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It soon became apparent that the weather wasn't going to improve any time soon. As the days went by the Canal &amp;amp; River Trust closed the River Trent in front of us and the River Soar behind, because of high water. Oh... We were stuck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n40/P3100562.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The River Soar is in Flood!&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The River Soar is in Flood!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the next couple of days we explored Loughborough, the birthplace of Ladybird Books (oh yes indeedy). We shared our time between Wetherspoons, the excellent (and free) museum, the well stocked aviary, the shops and the launderette.  We began to be concerned about our water running out so we decided to move around the corner into the wharf. We carefully picked our time to avoid the worst of the wind and rain. The rain fell in stair rods and the wind prevented us from mooring alongside the tap. We gave up and moored against the pontoon (with some difficulty) and hung all our wet clothes around the boat with towels beneath to catch the worst of the drips! The next day we were more successful, managing to collect water and re-moor without any trouble. Whilst waiting for the water tank to fill Tony used his fishing net to collect all the rubbish floating around in the wharf and binned it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were now in a mooring spot restricted to 24 hours but:-

&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;most of the facilities supposedly on offer were in fact out of order (toilets, elsan &amp;amp; showers)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;we couldn't travel due to rising water levels&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;No-one else was moored here or likely to arrive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;I am so fond of this statue. I have never been fond of a statue before. He is delightful. He is wearing and admiring a single sock. (In case you are worried, he also has a strategically placed fig leaf.) Bless him!.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n40/P3060522.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;8&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Guess what this huge mould was used for!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Well done Loughborough, this is what you call a war memorial! It is 46 metres tall and has a collection of 47 bells. It is open to the public but not until Easter. I wonder if we will still be here.....&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we thought the Canal &amp;amp; River Trust would probably leave us in peace.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile we are running out of coal and, as we can't travel to any marinas, have no chance of getting any more. Access to elsan points is also impossible (too much information?).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, we have been preserving our coal for the evenings and using public WC's (by that I mean in supermarkets, pubs and cafe's). This situation, of course, makes Wetherspoons and their bottomless top-ups (if that makes sense…)  invaluable! We are becoming very good at making the drinking of a single pint of beer fill the time available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Tony began to feel trapped. He was cheered only by sightings of the pet ferret being taken out on his daily walk and his regular trips (in the gaps in the weather) to the nearest lock to keep an eye on water levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n40/P3100560.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;10&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;On one of Tony's pilgrimages to the lock the water is at amber level - risky.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n40/P3140566.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;11&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The following day it is deeper, at red level - dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;On one of the better days weather-wise we decided to go for a walk along the towpath to see where the canal joins the River Trent and Erewash Canal at Trent Lock. We planned to treat ourselves to a pub lunch there and then catch the train back to Loughborough. On the way we saw a whole field full of lapwings rising just above the ground, doing a few acrobatics then landing again. The towpath gradually and mysteriously morphed into a public footpath on the flood plain alongside the river. We boldly continued on our way until we reached the junction. Trent Lock was on the opposite side of the river to us and there was no bridge. We were stranded on the flood plain. How could this happen? What did the horses used to do when towing a boat? Swim across?
We were dismayed. We could either walk back the way we had come with no hope of lunch, or carry on following the footpath across the floodplain towards civilisation. So we carried on, moving further away from the river, across farmland, to a small country road which we followed under the railway and into the village of Sawley, situated not far from a railway station. We found three pubs, one of which belonged to an unappealing chain, one served very sad looking food, the third was selling excellent ale from its own brewery but no food other than crisps and nuts. What to do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were so busy enjoying our beer (and very hot chilli bar snacks that actually made Tony cry) that we missed our first train. It had been a very close thing but 'a miss is as good as a mile'. Never mind, it wasn't a long wait for the next train and we were merry enough not to be too upset! We got back to the boat and had a slap-up curry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n40/IMG-20190308-WA0000.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;12&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;These cooling towers watched over us for most of the day.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n40/IMG-20190308-WA0006.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;13&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Lunch, of sorts...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By now we were well into March. We had originally travelled up here to kill time whilst we waited for the lock in Reading to open on 15th. So we decided to abandon our plan of going to Nottingham and head back to Oxford as soon as the canals were open again. We would, of course, take Liberty Belle to Nottingham some other time but for now, to keep ourselves entertained, we decided to go there by train. Our journey was uneventful (except that we saw those blessed cooling towers again). We collected a tourist map from the information centre and started to follow it. It was so windy that our map was soon swept away so we went back for 2 more! It soon became apparent that Nottingham likes its tourists to pay for its attractions. Now, don't get me wrong, that is absolutely fair enough .... but we restricted ourselves to the free stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the magical date of 15th March has come and gone. We are still here, in Loughborough, and Tony is still pacing up and down the towpath. Wetherspoons is an oasis for us. Not always an oasis of calm, due to the rugby, but we are not about to complain. The washing has been kept up to date, thanks to the launderette, some tinkering with DIY has been done and I have caught up with the Newsletters...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;1st - 6th March 2019&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Our route&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Bridges and swans on the approach to Leicester.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we approached Leicester we had our first abuse from a fisherman! He was a young chap with a young woman hovering in the background. He had been pointing out the water coming from the lock as we descended and had settled himself on the bank with his fishing rod. Liberty Belle was eased out of the lock. I stepped onto the deck after closing the gates, looked over at the fisherman and smiled. In response he stood up and shouted at us&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Don't you know you are supposed to slow down when you pass fishermen?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite us knowing that this isn't the case I simply pointed out that we couldn't go any slower without losing steering and he wouldn't want that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;I could report you!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tony suggested that he should go ahead and do that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Other people have been done you know!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We shrugged at him and carried on.  I hope the young woman was impressed by his knowledge and bravado otherwise the whole event was a waste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n39/P3020396.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;2&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Leicester Cathedral by night.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n39/P3020388.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;3&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;It is a small, neat, cheerful cathedral.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We stayed in Leicester for the weekend at our secure mooring at the Castle Garden. There was a lot of interesting architecture both old and new. You can't move around the city without regularly coming across information boards about its history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We visited the Cathedral where a very friendly curate, after inviting everyone to pause and join her in the Lords Prayer, smiled at me as we sat down then came and chatted to us about the cathedral, the different visitors they get there; the local rugby team colours; how she became a curate; her duties as curate; the funerals she had conducted... She made us feel very welcome and we liked her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ancient Guildhall, dating back to 1390, is beautiful and well worth a visit. It was due to be demolished in the 1920's because it had become dilapidated and was considered an eyesore but local historians thankfully stepped in and saved it, opening it as a museum in 1926.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The local market was excellent, with lots of vibrant stalls. It is undercover and the wooden stalls are permanent. In the evenings a group of Sikhs hand out food to the homeless from one of the stalls, to the sound of loud and jolly music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the main street there are billboards which have free integrated phones (modern ones with no handsets), WiFi, phone charging ports and access to local information. (BT Inlink). What a wonderful resource. We saw a couple of homeless people using them but they were first brought to our attention when we encountered a very drunk man shouting abuse relating to his mother at a billboard one late afternoon.  Of course it turned out that he was actually talking to his mother on the phone. I'm not sure which is worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having looked them up on the Infi-net it seems they have been installed in lots of places around the country...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the Saturday evening we attended an event celebrating the life of local suffragette, Alice Hawkins, in the square that contains her statue. It was entertaining, educational and very moving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We found some disappointments in Leicester. The Jewry Wall Museum (part of the Roman town) was closed for refurbishment and the Richard III museum was exhausting. We felt that it was no different from reading a book about him except you had to stand throughout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n39/P3020392.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;4&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;I cannot think of this chap without the accompanying Cockney rhyming slang. When I saw a local restaurant bearing his name, I couldn't help thinking that it was a bad move.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n39/P3020383.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;5&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Despite being named after me I wasn't invited to help myself from the stall. Rude.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Leicester's own Statue of Liberty (no relation to Liberty Belle). A poor copy of the New York one, placed on top of Liberty shoe factory. When the factory closed, she was saved and put on a roundabout.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n39/IMG-20190302-WA0002-crop2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;10&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;We can't help thinking that she must have looked better from a greater distance. If they had to save her, perhaps a taller pedestal would have been a good move...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the Monday we set off despite strong winds. It was slow going as we encountered some very heavy lock gates and one lock full of rubbish that we needed to push clear with the boat hook before we could open it. We got Liberty Belle in there, shut the gates behind her and started to empty out the water through the bottom gates. We soon realised that the top gates weren't shut properly so the water was just passing through both sets of gates. We had to stop, let the lock refill completely, ease apart the top gates and clear the rubbish caught between them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This involved Tony being precariously balanced on the partly opened gates which were desperately trying to shut together whilst he wielded the boat hook to push the rubbish out of the way. That done, we started again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we left Leicester the river was lined with parkland, old factories, new housing and a wildlife park. We saw cormorants, a kingfisher, a little grebe, herons, an egret and a pair of Gadwell ducks (identified by Tony The Birdman).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the last lock of the day Tony couldn't bring Liberty Belle to the side due to the wind, so after closing the gates I was left stranded! There were no opportunities for me to be picked up for half a mile. Despite trying to travel slowly, Liberty Belle was being swept along in the flow of the river so I had trouble walking fast enough to keep up, particularly as I had styles to climb and a muddy track to contend with! She must have been going at a crazy 4 miles an hour! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally we met at our nighttime mooring in Mountsorrel, just before the next lock. It was a fascinating little village with an ancient castle site and several sculptures done by a chap called Mike Grevatte.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Tony on the site of the Mountsorrel Castle, razed to the ground in the 13th century. I found this out on the infi-net - there was no information at all at the site. What a shame.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;I have no idea why a ladder and a pair of crutches are being used as a trellis, but there they are.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following day we travelled to Loughborough. On the way we saw loads of Canada Geese and some Greylags, a swan sitting bolt upright on a nest and our first ducklings (yay!). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We moored up just outside Loughborough Wharf in a residential area. We decided to stay there to shelter from the high winds expected on the following day.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rachel Glombek</name></author><summary type="html">Leicester to Loughborough</summary></entry></feed>
