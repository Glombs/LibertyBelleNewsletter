&lt;h2&gt;17th October - 2nd November 2020&lt;/h2&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Westport Lake&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having looked at the up-coming winter closures we decided that our plan should now be to fill in a few gaps on the Four Counties Ring section that we had missed so far, plus the Caldon Canal, followed by the Stourport Ring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had a return visit to Wolverhampton before turning north on the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal at Autherley junction, heading for Great Haywood via Gailey, Penkridge and Stafford; a new section to us. Along the way we saw a kingfisher, several heron, a woodpecker, a few jays, some Little Grebes and plenty of squirrels skipping along the towpath.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gailey sounds like a much more interesting place that it turned out to be. We had heard it was a popular place to moor but we couldn't honestly see why....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Penkridge, at the only pub open, we learnt from a local character rather more than we needed about Scottish exports. The people he had been talking to when we arrived seemed to be relieved that he had moved on to us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Stafford, we met a couple of friends who were walkers and very interesting to chat to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We finally arrived in Great Haywood, where Tony had been stung by a bee last time we were here. Thankfully it was too cold for bees this time.  We spent some time exploring the outside of the National Trust's Shugborough House estate. There is a beautiful bridge giving pedestrian access to the estate across the River Trent. It was built in 1550 by the Earl of Essex to enable Queen Elizabeth I to cross the river to go hunting. Originally it had 40 arches, now only 14 remain. (Presumably part of the bridge was demolished when the canal was built.) It is a long bridge but not very wide, so it proved to be inadequate for the Shugborough Hall residents who wished to travel by carriage. Another, wider bridge was built for them which became the preferred route.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next we were back on familiar 'ground', heading for Stoke-on-Trent, with an increasing amount of narrowboat traffic, passing through;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Weston, (past the only remaining inland salt marsh in Britain)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Stone, (past a lime kiln dating back to 1790's)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and on to Barlaston.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; the way we met a couple and their teenage son aboard a hire boat. The couple hoped to buy their own boat in the near future, and travel in much the same way as we are. At the locks, we shared any information we thought might be useful and generally encouraged them to go ahead with their plans. How exciting!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;A celebration of Stone. &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were a bit concerned about travelling through Stoke-on-Trent, particularly during half term, so we set off early in the morning to tackle the five locks before turning off onto the Caldon Canal, where we hoped to get through another 3 locks and a lift bridge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were just approaching the second lock of the morning when we heard a shout and saw someone in a hi-vis jacket waving us on. Tony pulled over to let me off and the lock gates magically opened. At first I thought it was a CRT volunteer but it turned out to be the very friendly, chatty, &quot;Rob the Lock&quot;, who sped ahead of us on his bike, setting and opening each lock for us, pausing briefly to help with the gates and paddles before zooming off ahead again. He even turned up the Caldon Canal to help us there too. Rob's day job is as a boat mover but he has very little work at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He used to volunteer with the CRT with whom he still has a good relationship. Rather than get bored sitting at home he has a full English breakfast, fills his panniers with energy drinks and zooms about the towpath on his bike, helping where he can. He says it's good for his physical and mental health. Well, he certainly did us some good, we sped up those locks in no time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Let's go left!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The very beginning of the Caldon Canal was industrial but pleasant enough. Then we came to Hanley Park which was a delightful surprise; a restored Victorian park with formal gardens, Pavilion Cafe, elegant band stand, lake, boathouse, decorative bridge and balustrades. We continued on along the increasingly pretty, winding canal and moored, as Rob had recommended, in Milton.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part way along, the Caldon Canal splits in two, with the main branch descending through some locks and heading for Froghall, and the second branch passing over the main canal on an aqueduct and heading for Leek. We went along the Leek Branch first. My goodness the views were fabulous. We decided there and then that we would stay in Leek for a few days to give us a chance to explore the area on foot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Settle down on a Leek bench, and rest like a hen on a pretzel.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suddenly there were rumours that there would be a second lockdown. The Caldon Canal, although absolutely beautiful, doesn't have much in the way of facilities for boaters, so it isn't ideal for an enforced lengthy stay. We needed to get to a mooring with easy access to an elsan point, a tap and some shops, at the very least. Also, if possible we wanted pretty views and interesting local walks...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at the map we decided to head for Westport Lake, near the Harecastle Tunnel, just a couple of days travel away, where there are boaters' facilities, (an elsan point, loo and shower) and taps within easy reach. We were a little sad to leave Leek so soon, but promised to return to the Caldon Canal and give it the time it deserves. We headed back the way we had come, turning right onto the Trent and Mersey Canal at Etruria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stopping off for diesel, coal and water on the way, we arrived at Westport Lake on Monday 2nd November and had the pick of the moorings. We settled on a space in a gap in the trees, where the solar panels had a chance of some sunshine and from where we could see the lake. That same evening we were all informed that the second lockdown would begin on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, here we are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The return to narrow canals!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We arrived back in Stratford-upon-Avon, Tony took back the hire car and, after a bit of lunch, we set off along the Stratford Canal to get a few locks done before the end of the day. Rivers are very exciting but being back on a narrow canal felt good. We had travelled this way two years before but I had forgotten how pretty the Stratford Canal is with its neat little bridges, aqueducts and cottages with barrel shaped roofs. These cottages were built using the same techniques as the bridges, possibly by the same people using the original wooden forms. Cunning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At one of the locks a group of teenage lads took quite an interest in us, asking all sorts of questions about the canal boating life, then wishing us well as we left. We meet a lot of interested people as we potter around the canals but usually they are people our own age or older, or young children, so this made a refreshing change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We spent the next day cruising all the way to Lowsonford's Fleur de Lys pub, 9 miles and 20 locks away. Tony introduced an added incentive by booking us a table there for Sunday lunch the following day. Having shared the driving and locking duties between us, we arrived in plenty of time for a relaxing beer in the garden before the afternoon was over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having enjoyed our delicious lunch (in very covid-aware surroundings), we set off again for Kingswood junction. As we passed under the oak trees lining the canal we were bombarded with acorns, it was quite violent!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n90/20201011-P1350165.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;8&quot; /&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;More neat little bridges and barrel roofed buildings.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Kingswood we were on the increasingly busy North Stratford Canal and hoped to complete 23 locks on the first day. We were lucky enough to have some help from the Canal &amp;amp; River Trust volunteers, one of whom escorted us up the main Lapworth Flight, forging ahead to set each lock, so the going was easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the day I observed a technique for opening the double lock gates which I couldn't help trying for myself. It didn't only save time and energy but was great fun too, so I was rather pleased with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We arrived at our destination in Lapworth by lunch time!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n90/20201012-P1350189.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;10&quot; /&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our plan was to get to Birmingham where we had arranged to meet up with Julia in a Jewellery Quarter cafe for lunch, but suddenly the city was put under extra restrictions which caused an emergency re-think! After a short discussion, we moved both the date and the venue back one space to the following day at the Fleur de Lys! Perfect. Not only did we see get to catch up with our Julia, we had another excellent meal and she presented us with a goody bag of homemade cakes, jam and pickle! We felt very spoilt indeed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We still had to travel through Birmingham so onwards and upwards!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;A sunny Gas Street Basin.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We moored in Gas Street Basin and briefly risked the market for some fresh veg, before moving swiftly on to moor outside the Black Country Museum, on our way north to explore some sections of canal new to us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time we travelled along the Birmingham New Main Line instead of the Old Main Line. The straight new canal (1827) was built to speed up the travel from Gas Street Basin to Tipton, avoiding the locks and winding nature of the Old Main Line. The older canal is much prettier than the new one but, having looked down on it from above, I was excited to be travelling along it at last.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was particularly looking forward to seeing the beautiful Engine Arm aqueduct from below. It didn't disappoint. Looking up at a decorative or well engineered bridge or aqueduct from below has a similar effect on me as looking up at the architecture inside a Church or Cathedral. Awesome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We spent another day in the museum, despite the weather being a little wet at times, and again managed to find a couple of bits we hadn't seen before. Of course we treated ourselves to fish and chips for lunch, finding a seat underneath a tram-stop shelter, away from the rain. 
Back at the boat we lit our first fire of the season.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The 'Ever-present Hill'.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leaving Gloucester Docks, we went back through the lock and onto the Partings, which held no fear for us now! We turned off the RIver Severn onto the River Avon at Tewkesbury. A large sign advised us to sound our horn as we approached the lock, which Tony did as he manoeuvred Liberty Belle towards the awkwardly angled lock landing. Suddenly the lock opened and we were ushered in by the lock keeper. The horn was to alert him to our presence rather than other boaters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lovely welcome; he checked our licence and gave us advice on the locks and mooring, explaining that we should look out for blue markers on the flood safe moorings. We moored immediately beyond the lock and walked into Tewkesbury. What a lovely town. We decided we would visit the Abbey the next morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Tewkesbury Abbey.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the early evening, Tony decided to try and get the heating to come on using the timer. We have never attempted this before but, as the temperature had become rather autumnal and we had a visitor on board, we thought it might be nice to wake up to a bit of warmth. However, despite watching videos on YouTube he couldn't quite get it to work, so he 'zero'ed' the timer, which meant it came on at midnight! Toasty!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tewkesbury Abbey was lovely but some of it was out of bounds and there wasn't enough information available about what we did see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the Abbey, we had hoped to have an afternoon tea, (birthday treat for yours truly), at the local cafe but we had been too quick and it was too early, so we bought birthday buns instead, took them back to the boat and enjoyed them on the move in the sunshine. (We also bought Tewkesbury sausages which turned out to be rivals for Braunston Bangers....!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The River Avon is beautiful with views of an ever-present hill which we wound around for ages! Kingfishers escorted us past splendid houses with well kept lawns and private landing stages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The autumn is definitely here with colourful trees brightening up the banks of the river and the distant woodlands.  The hedges are full of crab apples and berries, with blackthorn bushes so full of sloes that they create a purple haze in the sunshine.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Liberty Belle moored at one of the many excellent flood-safe mooring sites on the River Avon.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The River Avon navigation fell into disrepair after it was no longer commercially viable, as did most of the network, and was eventually restored using mostly private money and volunteers. Many of the locks were re-built by local borstal and Gloucester Prison inmates. Each lock is named twice, one name reflecting its locality and the other the main donor of the funds to rebuild it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On joining the River Avon, we had been instructed to tie Liberty Belle front and back before working the locks, (because they are double width and can be quite violent), which was time consuming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although all of them are smart and well kept, many of the locks are a bit odd, with weirs formed by piles of rocks creating wild-looking and rather lovely rapids;  landing stages that are at an odd angle or too short or both, and a couple that are an odd shape. One has a swing bridge across the top which needs to be moved out of the way before using the lock and then replaced afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another has a ground paddle located way off to one side, behind a large sign, and I forgot to put it down as we left. There was a boat right behind us and, as it passed our mooring, Tony managed to call out to them and apologise for my mistake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We explored the Georgian town of Pershore, (of plum festival fame), determined to get some local plum jam. There was an Abbey here too. We keep coming across Abbeys on this trip that claim to have been one of the wealthiest of its time....I can't help wondering where all the less wealthy ones were that these were compared to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 13th Century the monks from Evesham Abbey had a manual cable ferry to take them across the River Avon to tend their vineyard on the opposite bank in Hampton. There is a still pedestrian ferry in the same location, operated by pulling along a cable strung across the river, which is allowed to drop to the bottom when the ferry is at either bank, to allow passage of boats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tony remembered that he would need to sound his horn to alert the ferryman but there was no sign of anyone, the ferry was moored and the cable was already lowered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We attempted to moor at the first pontoon in Evesham but the flood-safe pillars, standing beyond the pontoon, were bigger than our fenders and rendered them useless, so we moved on to the main town moorings alongside the park, which were lovely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Evesham Abbey Gardens has it's own landing stage opposite our moorings.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We checked out the lovely Evesham and the remains of its Abbey, the outline of which is carefully picked out in paving slabs in the grounds, which is now a public park.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We moved on to Bidford where we also had a quick look around. We had picked up our pace because the forecast was for heavy rain over the next few days. This would inevitably raise the water level in the river and we were concerned that it would become un-navigable and we would be stranded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we had an early start in the rain leaving Bidford.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On rivers, as you approach a lock, the navigation divides in two, one arm going to the lock and the other towards the weir, or, in the case of the Avon, the rapids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the river divides around an island and either one route is navigable or they both are. Large arrows direct the boats to the navigable route, (some of them large enough to see in time without binoculars, which is helpful).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we were travelling along in the rain, we found ourselves with a set of rapids straight in front of us, with the water flowing quite strongly. I would have panicked if I hadn't been struck dumb and rigid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;thoughtbubble&quot;&gt;We must have come the wrong way!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;thoughtbubble&quot;&gt;Had there been a choice?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finding my voice I queried this with Tony. He couldn't remember there being a choice....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;thoughtbubble&quot;&gt;Would there be enough space to turn in front of the rapids without hitting any rocks?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The water looked fairly furious.... My chest felt quite tight... Why is this happening with Mum on board? We were still moving forward...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suddenly there was a sharp right turn into a lock. Wow!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We soon found ourselves at the Stratford-on-Avon lock, leading onto the canal. By this time, despite being very glad to be alive and afloat, we were a bit fed up of the rain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not realising that the lock landing was well before the lock, where the trip boat was moored, we had passed it by and found ourselves in front of the lock with no way for me to get off and open it. Tony managed to turn Liberty Belle, despite the wind, and we went back the way we had come. Tony turned again, pulled over behind the trip boat to let me off and waited mid-stream for me to set the lock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I approached I could see it was set against us with the canal-end lock gates wide open. At the river-end of the lock the only way of crossing to the other side was to use the elaborate bridge with curled ramps at both ends. I pulled closed the canal-side gate on my side and set off across the  over-lengthy bridge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the time I got to the other gate, the first gate had swung open again. I closed the second gate, walked to the river-end and opened the gate paddle a little, to start letting the water out, assuming that would pull the gate closed. Off again, over the bridge to shut the first gate. By this time, the first gate was open again.. Hurrumph.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I walked back to the river-side gates and opened the other paddle fully, letting the water gush out which held the first gate whilst I went over the bridge, again, and pulled closed the second gate. At last! I fully opened the first paddle and we were finally in business. All this time Tony had seen me pottering back and forth over the bridge with no obvious results...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At last, Liberty Belle was through the lock and we were moored in the basin, in dry clothes, watching the rain through the windows. We decided that we would bring the hire car booking forward by a couple of days, rather than sit in Stratford in the rain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following morning we moved Liberty Belle to a 14 day mooring outside the basin and drove Mary home. The good weather was over and the temperature was dropping, so Mary had seen the best of the autumn. It would be no fun if she was sheltering from the rain and cold in a boat with steamed up windows! Besides, we had kidnapped her for 4 weeks...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turned out to have been a good decision to crack on with our journey because the rivers did go into flood and no-one was allowed to travel on them for a few days. Well done Tony!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;signtranscript&quot;&gt;Your Majesty, our friend of many years,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;signtranscript&quot;&gt;Confirms a triumph now the moment nears:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;signtranscript&quot;&gt;The lock you have re-opened will set free&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;signtranscript&quot;&gt;The heart of England to the sea&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Where Next?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, we have abandoned the Caldon Canal, (which is absolutely delightful, even in the rain), and are now heading for a mooring suitable for a lockdown.

&lt;p&gt;After some investigation we decided that the mooring outside Westport Lake, between Stoke-on-Trent and the Harecastle tunnel, would suit us just nicely. When we passed by last time we thought it would be a pleasant place to stay. There are mooring rings, boaters' facilities, (including showers), nearby shops, access to countryside walks and birdwatching possiblilites at the lake. Strangely there doesn't seem to be a water tap, but there is one a short boat ride away, outside the tunnel, and a boatyard in the opposite direction, as well as a winding hole in both directions for turning.

&lt;p&gt;Tony walked up there today from our overnight mooring and confirmed that there is a lot of space, so we will hopefully be moored there tomorrow afternoon, in plenty of time for the new lockdown.

&lt;p&gt;Good luck everyone, stay safe. xx

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Correction:-&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the last newsletter there was a photo of Mary posing next to a WAAF poster. I incorrectly stated that Mary was in the WAAF but, of course she was in the WRAF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A silly mistake for me to make.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The WAAF is the Women's Auxilliary Air Force, set up to support the RAF men, whereas the WRAF  was the Women's Royal Air Force, the women's equivalent to the RAF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, it goes without saying, that this was during the Cold War, not WWII...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Gloucester and Sharpness Canal.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After leaving the museum we set off through Netherton Tunnel, past the Merry Hell shopping centre and down the pretty Delph Lock flight to Brierley Hill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mary used to attend the Grammar School in Brierley Hill. It was right next to the canal, which for her, back then, was just the source of the mist that obscured the playground. Sadly, we passed the grammar without realising it -  now a primary school - and the town itself was disappointingly 'down at heel'.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;This indicates that an anchor making industry used to be here. One of Mary's Grandfather's was an anchor maker...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We continued down memory lane past Stourbridge, through Stewponey, (which wasn't as interesting to look at as it sounds), to Kinver, (where Mary grew up), and on to Kidderminster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The canal around here is absolutely beautiful. Tony and I have promised ourselves that we will re-visit over the winter to have a jolly good look around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually we arrived in Stourport-on-Severn.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;...and add its name to the lists around the sides.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mary had started a pattern of walking alongside the boat on the towpath first thing in the morning, helping with the pushing and pulling of lock gates and then sitting at the front of the boat in the sunshine to admire the views. We now had the River Severn ahead of us, which would be a different kettle of fish, so to speak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The land alongside rivers is generally privately owned so there isn't necessarily a tow path; the edges of the river do not necessarily allow the boat to approach close enough for crew to get on or off because of rocks, shallow water or deep vegetation; if a path does exist it often wanders away from the river and may not return.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All these factors mean that walking alongside the boat for exercise is not an option so Mary was a bit more confined to the boat but we tried to make up for it by having a little walk around the places where we were moored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n88/20200922-P1340519.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;22&quot; /&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another difference between canals and rivers is that you cannot necessarily moor on a river just because it is lunch time. On our first day on the Severn we resigned ourselves to a sandwich on the go on the understanding that we had fish and chips when we arrived in Upton-upon-Severn. It is a very pretty little town which takes great pride in its public places and also sells great fish suppers!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;A change in the weather...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the River Severn travels South, before joining the Gloucester and Sharpness Canal, there is a section that is tidal, called The Partings. Boaters must contact the lock keeper ahead to check that passage is safe before taking a deep breath and holding it until safely on the canal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knowing we had a lot ahead of us before we reached the safety of moorings in Gloucester, we set off, despite the rain, just like Doctor Foster before us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though it was raining, the wildlife were still out and about of course, and I was lucky enough to see a pair of Lesser Spotted Woodpeckers fly across our path and land on the trunk of a tree alongside the river. I was so chuffed!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the last lock before The Partings, (Upper Lode Lock), the keeper asked us if it was our first time on this part of the river. Having said it was, he bombarded us with information and lowered a damp leaflet of instructions down to Tony by way of a bucket on a rope. If we weren't worried before, we were now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He suggested we stop at some visitor moorings on a particular pontoon for an hour, to make our timings right. We should contact the next lock from there, to check that it was safe to continue, as there were reports of some debris on the tidal section, which may or may not allow us to pass an oncoming boat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite having our eyes peeled for visitor moorings, we didn't identify them until we had gone past them...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tony phoned ahead and was told that all was well, we should continue to the lock which would be open as there was a boat just leaving, which we would see on the way. There was a large branch in the water but there would be plenty of room. The second lock keepers calm, easy going attitude was reassuring and he was quite right, there was nothing to worry about and we soon found ourselves safely in Gloucester.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n88/20200923-P1340635.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;29&quot; /&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Safely in Gloucester Lock&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of us had ever been to Gloucester and had no particular expectations, so we were delighted to find a fine and interesting historic town. The docks reminded me of a small Liverpool, with the buildings beautifully preserved and well presented with plenty of information boards and a friendly, relaxed atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Gloucester's Mariners Church in the background.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We decided to visit the Cathedral the following morning, then Mary treated us to lunch in the Cathedral Cafe. Tony found some online guided walks highlighting places of interest and including information and anecdotes, so we were kept busy in the afternoon exploring the town.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My goodness there have been a lot of monks here, Blackfriars, Whitefriars and Greyfriars to name a few, plus the oddly named Llanthony Secunda Priory, housing Augustinian Canons who came to Gloucester when they were being persecuted in Wales, then refused to return when told it was safe to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suffice to say, we didn't do it justice, so will need to return sometime in the future (probably not by boat).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, off again, along the Gloucester and Sharpness Canal, from Gloucester to.....Sharpness!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Gloucester and Sharpness Canal runs alongside the River Severn, with the Cotswold hills on one side and the Monmouthshire hills on the other. We took a couple of days to get to Sharpness, stopping at Frampton-on-Severn on the way. The weather did us proud again and the views were stunning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;...and right.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n88/20200925-P1340706.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;51&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;We didn't need to have this swing bridge moved for little ol' us!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n88/20200925-P1340765.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;52&quot; /&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;An old Cadbury Wharf.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are no locks on this canal but many swing bridges, some electronic and others manual, each operated by a friendly keeper waiting in a little office alongside. Every swing bridge has associated traffic lights which initially show red, then flash when the keeper has spotted you, finally turning green when you are invited to continue your journey. So civilised!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Oh, the disappointment!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We turned outside the docks and moored in the visitor moorings alongside the tidal River Severn. We had a little look around near our moorings, remembering to wave to Cathy in Bristol as we did so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following day we headed back the way we had come, all the way to Gloucester.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Footnotes:-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;fn1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;The Severn Railway Bridge, which included a swing bridge across the Gloucester and Sharpness Canal, was built to transport coal over the river to Sharpness. Several boats collided with the pillars supporting the bridge, due to the difficulty of steering in the tidal section of the river, but there was one particularly huge disaster in 1960 which finally resulted in the demolition.

&lt;p&gt;Two tankers, (one carrying oil, the other coal), heading for Sharpness Dock, missed the entrance in the thick fog and found themselves fighting the incoming tide, unable to turn back. They both crashed into the railway bridge, damaging themselves, the bridge, and a gas main. The leaking oil ignited, setting the river ablaze; the gas main exploded and the tanker carrying coal caught alight, much extending the life of the fire. Five men died in the tragedy.

&lt;p&gt;Reconstruction of the bridge was attempted but was abandoned due to costs and it was finally demolished in 1967.

 &lt;p&gt;Pretty Ashby Canal.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There we were in Coventry Basin, all packed up to go, with a hire car booked to take us to fetch Mary. Tony set off on foot to collect the car from the nearest Enterprise office, as arranged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He arrived to find the building closed and no-one about. Curious. He contacted Enterprise and it turned out that they had given him the location of an office that was not in operation. They sent him a taxi which took him to the correct location. Here he was given the car and he drove back to the boat. All this took rather longer than we had expected and was a stressful start to the journey, but all was well in the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had hoped to take Mary onto the Ashby canal but it was lacking in water, so we had changed our plans and were going to circle through Birmingham, join the River Severn and then the Avon, returning to Birmingham via Stratford.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The evening before we set off, with Mary on board, we received an email from the CRT to say that the Ashby Canal was now replenished. Excellent. So we went back to our original plan, (or rather, attached our original plan onto the front of our new plan).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Off we went, back along the Coventry Canal, past Hawkesbury Junction and on to Marston Junction where we got ready to turn under the bridge and onto the Ashby. Inevitably we had a boat close behind us and we met a boat coming off the Ashby towards us under the bridge. Not just any boat but a very long one which had trouble turning. Eventually after a bit of boat ballet (?) all was sorted out and each of the three boats managed to end up where it had intended to be and facing the right way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We immediately liked the Ashby; following the contours of the land gives it a winding nature and with no locks at all to keep us busy, it has a sedate air. The weather did us proud and we were able to admire it at its best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We spent several days travelling on this stretch of canal, stopping off at;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stoke Golding, where King Henry VII was crowned after defeating Richard III at the battle of Bosworth&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Market Bosworth, a pretty, small town. Mary, having been before, was able to show us around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Snarestone, where Mary made full use of the children's play area...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shackerstone, the end of the line for us as the canal is no longer navigable beyond here.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Snarestone Wharf. The end of the navigable Ashby Canal.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were a little disappointed at the lack of wildlife on the Ashby, specifically kingfishers and heron. We wondered whether there was a lack of fish or maybe suitable breeding areas but came to no conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, on our last day we were in for a special treat. Having turned around at the top end and headed back, we were moored for the night not far from the junction. We arose the next morning and were surprised to see, on the opposite side of the canal, a water vole, collecting and enjoying his breakfast whilst we enjoyed ours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What a delight it was to see him busying about in plain sight. We were thrilled. For us the Ashby Canal will forever be associated with this little chap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Hello Ratty!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We turned off the Ashby and back onto the Coventry Canal, this time heading North. We moored at Atherstone over night where we had a little look around and did a bit of shopping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n87/IMG_20200914_091713317.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;18&quot; /&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The game must remain in Long Street and no-one is allowed to kill anyone.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Polesworth onwards, the canal was rather lovely, helped of course by the glorious weather.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The peace was broken by a woman working in her garden alongside her moored boat who yelled at Tony, who was gently chugging along at a suitable slow speed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Where's the fire???!!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure what she wanted him to do. He could have stopped the engine I suppose but steering isn't going to work then and we would still be there. The alternative would be to reverse but what would that have achieved? Boaters can be a funny lot.....
Tony didn't bother to respond. It seemed pointless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Continuing along we swung southwards through Fazeley Junction onto the Birmingham and Fazeley. Last time we did this turning, many hands got involved towing and shoving Liberty Belle around the sharp corner. We braced ourselves for the repeat performance but, strangely, it all happened very smoothly.... What a difference a couple of years' experience makes!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n87/20200915-P1340165cropped.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;20&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Oh, North, please.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n87/20200915-P1340161.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;21&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Fazeley Junction&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Onwards, avoiding Spaghetti Junction with another sharp turn at Salford junction, (Tony has definitely got the hang of this), onto the old Birmingham and Warwick. We moored for the night outside Star City, behind a couple of other boats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later that evening a hire boat arrived in the dark. Poor devils. It's quite stressful to still be travelling along after night has fallen, hoping to find a mooring before the next lock... The narrow boat in front of us were quick to respond and moored them up alongside, tying the newcomer up to their own boat. So kind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;I'm not sure why but I felt obliged to stand here.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following morning we were hoping to set off early and get started on the locks ahead. We were initially a little disappointed that the boat in front of us, having swapped places with the hire boat, set off before us. This meant of course that the locks would definitely be set against us. Oh well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hadn't factored in how kind the two couples on board had already proved to be. As they left each lock they closed it up and left a crew member to open one of the paddles to start emptying it for us. Wonderful. This made the whole process so much easier for us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After 5 locks we parted ways at the junction; they joined the Grand Onion and we headed off for the Digbeth Branch with a little diversion into Typhoo Basin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n87/20200916-P1030295.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;28&quot; /&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Don't mind if I do!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This brought us back to rejoin the Birmingham and Fazeley. Only 13 more locks and we would be in the city centre. Mum helped with the steep climb, pushing and pulling lock gates. I went on ahead to set the next lock where I could.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Half way up, I was just operating a paddle to empty a lock for us and a chap on a bike stopped and remarked that it was a shame 'he' was making me do all the hard work. I pointed down to the previous lock, indicating Mary and said,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;What about my Mother?&quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Oh my god, that's sooo much worse!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Birmingham! Hurrah! Although, in these strange times, there isn't much you can safely do in the cities. We had a little wander around, marvelling at the reduction in the hoardings and watching the new trams in action. Mary and I tried to get into the library so that I could show her all its marvels, including the Shakespeare room, but it wasn't to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we approached the door a masked face appeared through a small gap and asked us what we wanted. I explained but apparently you have to have some specific and important library sanctioned task before you can be admitted to limited areas....blah, blah, blah.... so we shrugged off the idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having had a little look around and stocked up our larder, we left for new moorings, turning onto the Birmingham Old Main Line and travelling the few miles to the Black Country Museum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;...a stretch of beautiful countryside in the city.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We booked ourselves into the museum for the following day. Now, that was more like it! Such a lovely welcome! We had to stop and be chatted to by several staff members (in character) before we finally got to the office where we were able to show our annual tickets and purchase one for Mary. It appears that ours have been extended for an extra 6 months to April. How delightful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet again we spent a whole day at the museum and failed to complete it all. They keep adding new attractions! This time WWII characters were there introducing food rationing and Dig for Victory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 'characters' have moved outside and many new signs have been put up to keep people at a suitable distance but we were still able to explore the buildings and, most importantly, we were able to have our fish and chips with a beer. I love this place. (It would have been a very different experience in the rain, but, yet again, we were very lucky with the weather.)&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Oh yeah!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst we were moored outside the Black Country Museum, Tony went to check out the boaters facilities and somehow found himself pulling the red emergency cord in the toilet/shower room, mistaking it for the shower pull. He couldn't see how to switch it off. We all wondered how long it would take for someone to come and see who needed rescuing.....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, we will never know, because Tony eventually went back and finally found a reset button. Suffice to say, no-one rushed to anyone's aid. Interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Plans:-&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are just about to start the Four Counties Ring, filling in a few bits that we have missed out so far, including the Caldon Canal. At the moment navigation of the Caldon Canal is restricted due to a sandbank having been dumped in the middle of it by the river as a result of the recent heavy rain. We are hoping that something will have been done about this before we get that far. Fingers crossed...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Footnotes:-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;fn1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;
Although it was planned that the canal would go through Ashby-de-la-Zouch to the River Trent, only the first 30 miles were ever completed and only 22 miles have been restored so far.

 &lt;p&gt;Liberty Belle as seen from Fotheringhay Castle.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We set off from Peterborough in some very strong winds making it difficult to steer. Travelling up the River Nene, boats enter the locks under the guillotine style gates which are left open, so getting into the locks was relatively simple. However, once Liberty Belle was out of the other end, Tony had to control her in the strong winds, pulling over to the lock landing, waiting to collect me whilst I stayed behind to empty the lock and re-lift the guillotine gate. Then he had to somehow steer her away from the lock landing in order to set off again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On one occasion I wasn't strong enough to pull the gates shut behind us so I had to abandon them. On another, there was a boat moored at the lock landing leaving no room for Liberty Belle to pull over to collect me after exiting the lock, so I had to get on before we left the lock with the gates still open. By the time we got to Fotheringhay Castle we were rather tired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following morning the wind had dropped and life should have been easier, except someone left the windlass at one of the locks. We didn't realise this until we arrived at the next one, some time later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tony thought the footpath along the river might be accessible from the lock and one of us could walk back to fetch it, however, that turned out not to be so... We couldn't turn around where we were, so, using a spare windlass, we travelled through the lock to turn on the other side where there was more space, immediately re-entering the lock and travelling back the way we had come. Arriving at the previous lock, I picked up the windlass and we turned again. Thank goodness the weather was on our side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, back along the same stretch of river for the third time that morning; back past all the swimmers, kayakers and walkers that had noticed we were rather familiar. We explained ourselves several times...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Before our Middle Levels experience, we would have thought this bridge was low.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually we arrived outside the pub in Wadenhoe. Tony decided that, although black clouds had gathered, it wasn't going to rain, and off he went to the bar. I was a little behind him and by the time I was ready to join him the rain was coming down in sheets. I took our large umbrella with me but the rain seemed to bypass that and attack me from all sides and from underneath. I was soaked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sloshed my way into the bar which was surprisingly busy, so we stood waiting for the rain to subside a bit before going into the garden. We positioned two chairs together under the umbrella, wiped the seats down and settled in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the recommendation of the landlord, we later went to look around the tiny but fascinating village before settling down for the night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n86/20200823-P1030005.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;15&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Inside the dovecote there is a swinging ladder that gives access to each of the 650 nesting boxes.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Off again. Surely today will be trouble free. Well, not entirely. At one of the locks the electrically operated guillotine gate was out of order and needed to be operated manually. In these situations a large wheel is provided with some mechanism for stopping it from unwinding on its own. In this case it was a chain which is padlocked to a ring welded onto the wheel. The padlock is opened using a key provided for such things. In this particular case we could open the padlock and close it again but could not remove our key afterwards. As the key would be needed many times again over the next few days, this was a problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We managed to wedge the windlass into the mechanism to hold the wheel temporarily and Tony contacted the River Agency who suggested we do our best. I was worried that we would break the key in the lock. Eventually I managed to remove it but this left the padlock in the locked position, not attached to the wheel. This meant the guillotine couldn't be locked in the raised position, as it should be. After much struggling and some WD40 we finally had a lifted gate, a secured wheel and a separate key.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n86/20200824-P1030031.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;16&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The windlass jamming the wheel.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;(Note the broken electric motor flung on the ground beneath)&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These were all small complications and certainly didn't prevent us from appreciating our surroundings and the wildlife around us. We saw plenty of kingfishers darting around which are always delight. One of the several cormorants we saw was in the river ahead of Liberty Belle, wrestling with a very large fish which it finally subdued and swallowed before it noticed us bearing down on him and flew off. We also spotted some goosanders, which are a rare treat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On reaching Irthlingborough we found a mooring opposite a nature reserve and were delighted to discover that it was home to several Great Egrets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;I tried to photograph the cormorant with his fish.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The fish is inside the cormorant.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;One of the egrets.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We stayed moored in Irthlingborough to sit out storm Francis' strong winds, which made it difficult to stand upright, let alone steer a boat. Another narrow boat was moored nearby and the two skippers discussed their plans for the next few days whilst observing the rising water levels. (11 inches and counting...)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following our neighbours' example we went to the local nature reserve, 'Stanwick Lakes', for a take away coffee. We arrived just in time before they closed up due to the strong winds. Being careful not to have the cups blown out of our hands and certainly not daring to take the lids off, we sat down at picnic tables near each other and sipped our drinks through the tiny little holes in the lids.....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both boats were heading to Norton, so we hatched a plan to travel together to make life easier at the locks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later, back at the boat, Tony and I were unaware that our bow rope was slipping free. Our neighbour, Jim, left the safety of his boat and came to rescue us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus began the Liberty Belle and Barney partnership.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;...and all kinds of sculptures.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, the following day, storm Francis having blown himself out, we set off in convoy, sharing the work all the way to Norton.
We moored overnight together at Hardwater Mill and then Becket's Park in Northampton (where we stayed for a day because the weather forecast wasn't good). We continued our partnership the following day but temporarily lost Barney just before we moored up for the night at Weedon Bec (where we snuck out for a curry, which seems to have become a tradition of ours).&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;History AND beer!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We rejoined forces with Barney in the morning for the last leg into Norton Junction, where we moored up and went with Jim and Margaret to the nearby pub for a pint or two to say our goodbyes. It was sad to break up the 'dream team' but we now had to go our separate ways; Barney to his marina and Liberty Belle to Braunston, where she had an appointment with a man who was going to replace her domestic batteries. (We had been warned when we bought Liberty Belle that her batteries were rather tired but we had soldiered on until now.)&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst in Braunston we helped the local economy by having second breakfast at the Gongoozlers' Cafe two days in a row, buying several plumbing bits from the chandlers, (see the radiator story from the last newsletter), and filling the fridge full of Braunston Bangers. In between all the eating, Tony re-tiled the fireplace, again. (It has become an annual event).&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Bye bye Braunston.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once our new domestic batteries had been fitted, we set off for Coventry, via Rugby. The weather was rather wet but not unpleasantly so and we arrived to find the ideal mooring in Coventry Basin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Back in Coventry Basin, almost 2 years after our last visit.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;We went to look at the back of the Weavers houses.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Originally built by a Quaker to enable individual weavers to compete with factory workers.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our plan was to collect a hire car, load it up with our washing, and leave Liberty Belle for a few days whilst we popped back to the house and collected Mary for a cruising holiday with us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Footnotes:-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;fn1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the Medieval era Dovecotes were owned by manor houses or monasteries. Over the centuries other more lowly people were allowed to have them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pigeons were free to leave through vents in the roof. Nothing was wasted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The feathers were used to stuff bedding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The droppings were used not just as fertiliser and saltpetre for gunpowder but also to treat baldness, gout and tumours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each pair of pigeons produced 2 offspring 8-10 times a year for 7 years. The chicks, or squabs, were collected when a few weeks old and roasted on spits, pickled, fried, stewed, braised, used in pies, dumplings, fritters and 'pigeon in a hole'. They were not only versatile and nutritious but also prevented plaque and other diseases (?).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can imagine, this appeals to Tony and he has threatened to build one in the garden as soon as we return to the house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;16th - 21st August 2020&lt;/h2&gt;

 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/maps/n85map.png&quot; alt=&quot;Our route&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Our route&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;

 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n85/20200816-P1330551.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;A change in the weather.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After completing the River Great Ouse and her tributaries we were ready to re-cross the tidal section and return to the Middle Levels to do a bit more exploring. We were booked through the Denver Lock at 5pm, when the tide would be just right for us to scoot the short distance across to Salters Lode Lock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we left Ely and headed towards the lock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n85/20200816-P1330554cropped.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;2&quot; /&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;A heron leads the way.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We arrived at the lock in plenty of time. Another boat was moored at the landing stage, obviously going through at the same time as us, so we hung about nearby. The sky became darker and darker, the rain began and we could hear thunder in the distance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n85/20200816-P1330605.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;6&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;

 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n85/20200816-P1330606.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;7&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Denver Lock under a black sky.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just after our allotted time the other boat was called into the lock and we were ushered in alongside. It was explained to us that when the tide was just right, the other boat would be told to leave; we should give them a 5 minute head start and he would signal for us to go. When we arrived at the other lock it would be fully open and both boats should just glide straight through. It would be a tight turn but we should give it a wide arc. All was calmness and smiles, despite the rain. Golly there was a lot of rain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lock gates opened and the first boat led the way. Suddenly we were ushered out too; that wasn't 5 minutes! As we entered the open river the thunderstorm suddenly raged above us. The rain came down so hard we could barely see where the river went!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We could however, see that the other boat had cut the corner into the other lock rather too much and was aground across the entrance. There was some shouting and the boat rocked and fidgeted, finally coming free and a second attempt to enter the lock was made but again, she was aground. She came free in reverse, shot forwards and disappeared. Was she through? Was it safe to turn into the mouth of the lock ourselves? We would just have to hope that we didn't smack into the back of her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here goes! The lock keeper appeared and encouraged us forward. We gave it our best shot, thankfully missing the wooden barrier on the left and avoiding the shallow patch on the right, we glanced off the wall (suitably lined with old car tyres) and were faced with a closed lock gate! The whole process had taken so long that the lock was no longer open. Gradually the gate was lifted and we made our way in. We were soaked but with so much adrenaline flowing we barely noticed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lock keeper was also dripping wet but that didn't stop him from being cheerful and welcoming, suggesting that we spend the night on his lock landing. We were very grateful for the suggestion and, with much relief, moored up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n85/IMG_20200817_084619_518.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;8&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Waking up outside Denver Lock...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;...where the resident kingfisher

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plan for the next day was to travel the Middle Level drains to the town of Ramsey, where we hoped to find suitable moorings and have a little look around. The day started well with good weather and some kingfishers to cheer us on our way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n85/20200817-P1330614.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;10&quot; /&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;&quot;UP TO DATE COTTAGE - 1901&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;If you say so...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We passed back through Marmont Priory Lock, where the lock keeper and her granddaughter spotted us and came out to make sure all was was well. (When we booked passage through in the other direction and had to help two hire boats through, she was nowhere to be seen until all the fuss was over...)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We turned onto Popham's Eau, new 'ground' for us and then turned again onto the functionally named Sixteen Foot Drain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n85/20200817-P1330665.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;12&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;A meeting of two drains.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n85/20200817-P1330676.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;13&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;In the stormy light the duck weed looks stunning.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once on the Middle Levels we discovered the bridges were a bit lower than we had expected or the water level was a bit higher. Whichever it was, the result was the same. We squeezed under the first bridge and the next one looked similar. However, it turned out to be rather saggy in the middle and Liberty Belle caught her solar panel brackets. The noise was horrible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n85/20200817-P1330678.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;14&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Tony thought this was the lowest bridge, but he was soon to find a lower one...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n85/IMG_20200817_164410342_HDRcropped.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;15&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;...that caused the damage to the solar panel brackets.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once we were free of the bridge, we turned onto the Forty Foot Drain. Very slowly we attempted another low bridge but this time we had to admit defeat. Thankfully there was enough room to turn around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were very lucky indeed to find a mooring spot. It was almost miraculous. There had certainly been no others on the way. Despite there being no signs to deter us, we were sure it must be a private mooring, so I clambered up the steep bank to see if we could get permission to stay until the morning. There were two houses across the road opposite the mooring. I managed to find some people in the yard at the back of one and they said it didn't belong to anyone as far as they knew and we were as welcome as anyone to use it. Wow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After some thought we decided that, although the height of the water seemed to be dropping, there was no guarantee that it wouldn't rise again. If we did continue to Ramsey, there is no knowing when we would be able to leave! We agreed to play it safe and return the way we had come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; So, we set off again first thing in the morning, a little disappointed that we hadn't reached Ramsey but relieved that we had made the decision not to tempt fate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So back we travelled through March and Whittlesey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Back in March&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;(the town, not the month...)&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n85/IMG_20200818_171239732cropped.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;18&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The ceiling beams in the Ship Inn are beautifully carved.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The story is that they &quot;fell off a back of a barge&quot; during the building of Ely Cathedral!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n85/20200819-P1330750.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;19&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The canal through March was full of dead fish.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Liberty Belle's fishing consultant, Aub, says they may have died from lack of oxygen in the water due to the excessive heat.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then on to Stanground Lock, which we had booked ahead. This time through, the lock keeper asked for our centre rope which she tied up at a bollard. She then asked Tony to run the engine in gear to keep the rope taut. We remarked how unusual this request was, as we are usually asked to switch the engine off. She said there was an undercurrent in the lock and it had always been done this way since her grandfather's time as lock keeper. How wonderful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n85/20200820-P1330810.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;20&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Keep that rope tight.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suddenly we were back in Peterborough where we found the perfect mooring next to the car park. You may well wonder why we wanted that particular spot....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, as you ask, it was an important part of the Great Radiator Replacement Adventure, which went a bit like this...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;One leaking radiator. Oh heck.&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;(.......time lapse ......)&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;A second leaking radiator.&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;Much measuring and searching online for suitable radiators in stock somewhere we will be arriving at soon....&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;The decision to purchase 3, as the third leaking radiator was only a matter of time.&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;The worry about carrying 3 radiators from wherever the shop is to wherever we are moored...&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;The decision to order them in Peterborough and to hire a car to transport them&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;The draining and removal of the old radiators and discovery of a long term small leak....&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;Tony's oft repeated refrain - &quot;I hate plumbing&quot;&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;The search for a radiator tool, purchased and found to be the wrong size&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;the attempt to alter the tool so that it would fit....&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;the long search for a plumbing shop that sells the correct tool (the imperial version)&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;the finding of the correct tool in B&amp;amp;Q&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;the inability to take the old radiators to the dump due to not being a resident of Peterborough, so taking them to a scrap metal firm instead&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;the fitting of the new radiators&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;the unsuccessful search in Tony's on-board plumbing supplies for the particular washer to repair the long term leak&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;the purchase of some suitable washers online, sent to our house to be collected later&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;the purchase of some radiator joints containing the suitable washers from some bloke on ebay, also sent to the house&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;the decision to try really hard to get the washers now, before going home, so that the radiators will be ready for Mary's arrival in early September.&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;the social distance queuing at the chandlers to try to buy a plumbing joint containing a suitable washer - twice. Both purchases proving to be the wrong type.&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;giving up and moving onto the servicing of the engine, only to find suitable washers for the radiators in the box of engine bits...&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;the re-filling of the radiators, with the incorrect mix of water and anti-freeze&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;the draining of the radiators&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;the re-filling with the correct mix&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What a palaver!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, we now have 3 brand new radiators that work and don't leak....! *&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Not to mention the National Collection of washers for these particular plumbing joints.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;&quot;I hate pumbing.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Notes:-&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ancient town of Ely was built on a clay island, the highest land in the Fens, which was surrounded by marsh land until the drains were built. The clay was quarried and the marshes provided the settlement with peat, willow, rushes and eels. The Abbey there became very wealthy and their glorious cathedral reflects this.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;So impressive.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a quick look around this fascinating city, we decided that the outside of the cathedral was so grand that we wanted to look inside, so Tony booked some tickets for the following morning. We were so pleased we did. Despite the covid masks and one way system, we found Ely Cathedral awesome. If you like a dramatic cathedral, visit Ely. We took photos but they don't do it justice.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Maybe they should have had an eel.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We dragged ourselves away from Ely, continuing along the Great Ouse before turning onto the River Cam, another of its tributaries, and onto the Cambridgeshire Lodes. The Lodes are ancient, navigable drains that branch off the River Cam like the fingers of a clawed hand. They were built by the Romans and, despite various alterations over the centuries, remain essentially the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The modern gateway to the Lodes is through Upware Lock, which is unusual. It has a guillotine gate at both ends but even more interesting is that it automatically resets itself 15 minutes after it's last use. Just beyond the lock is a water tap, so we were able to fill up our tank and witness the resetting. Fascinating!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n84/20200806-P1330197.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;17&quot; /&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Enough said.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our exploration of this area began along Reach Lode from which we branched off onto Wicken Lode, around a very tight bend. This was very narrow and absolutely beautiful. The surrounding land, Wicken Fen, is owned by the National Trust and, although the waterway itself is very quiet, the pathway alongside is well used by walkers and cyclists. We turned and slipped into a mooring then went to explore the village of Wicken, which had lots of visitors on this hot, sunny day, particularly in the gardens of the tea room and sitting at the tables on the village green outside the Maid's Head.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we got back to Liberty Belle, there was a second narrow boat moored next to her. So maybe the waterway is more popular than we thought....let's hope we don't meet anyone on the way back to the junction....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems that simply hoping doesn't always work. We met a little steam launch head-on. They managed to squeeze themselves against the bank and somehow we got past each other without incident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n84/20200805-P1330125.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;26&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The little steam launch after our successful passing.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On we went to the junction where we attempted to turn onto Burwell Lode. It was very tight and we managed to get wedged across the waterway, effectively blocking the junction. Right behind us was the little steam launch. We apologised over our shoulders as we tried to free poor Liberty Belle; Tony with the Barge Pole and me in charge of pushing against the side of the bridge and driving. After a certain amount of time, which was just long enough to be embarrassing in front of the other boat, we freed ourselves and the steam launch shot off to the right as we went left. Wise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n84/20200805-P1330152.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;27&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The little steam launch escaping from us for the second time in one day.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of Burwell Lode, there was no room left at the moorings so, instead of spending the night there, we returned to Reach Lode and followed it to the end, thankfully finding a mooring in Reach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reach has been inhabited for 2,000 years and in medieval times was a busy port. There is little sign of that now in the sleepy village except for once a year when it holds its annual fair. The fair began in 1210 and has been held every year since except, of course, this year (and possibly during the Black Death). It is held on the large village green which was created by flattening the end of the Devil's Dyke, a 7 mile long Anglo-Saxon earthwork, built for defence but also a trade route, stretching from Reach to Newmarket Racecourse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The village of Reach.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Returning to the River Cam we headed for Cambridge, stopping at Clayhithe on the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We spent a couple of days in Cambridge. Unfortunately it was far too hot to explore very much so we spent most of our time seeking shade. We were able to meet up with Dave and Fiona under one of the trees near Liberty Belle, which was delightful.  We have decided that we definitely didn't do justice to Cambridge so we will return one day, without Liberty Belle, and give it the attention it deserves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Guess who we saw!  Scooting along past our mooring. Perhaps they saw us and decided to make a hasty retreat.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it was time to leave, we turned and travelled back along the Cam to the River Great Ouse, turning south.
At the Stretham Pumping Station we met up with Joe and Kirsty who were on their way home from Norwich. Carter kept popping inside the boat, probably hoping that it was cooler indoors but it most certainly wasn't. Instead they all cooled off in the river before continuing their journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;A cooling break in their journey from Norwich.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We continued our journey, too, and arrived at Hermitage Lock which was a bit of a surprise as it was displaying a red traffic light. As Tony pulled over to the lock landing the light turned green so he dropped me off and continued into the lock. I immediately realised I was trapped. There was no exit from the pontoon. There was a piece of laminated A4 paper attached to the fence, bent over in the breeze. It was to inform boat crews that they should stay on their boat as the lock was manned. Oh. I clambered through two sets of railings, under chains strung across both ends of the lock gate bridge, climbed down a ladder covered in weed and dropped onto Liberty Belle's deck. The lock was operated from above and as we left I caught the lock keeper's eye and smirked guiltily. He said I was very agile!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just as we left the lock and were approaching the nearby moorings in Earith, we suddenly saw what we thought was an otter diving under water. As soon as we were tied up we got the binoculars out and scoured the area. It turned out to be a seal! Not as thrilling as an otter but still exciting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n84/20200809-P1330341.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;40&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Have we spotted a shy otter?&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n84/IMG_20200809_200101_719.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;41&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;No, it's a very curious seal.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After our overnight stay in Earith, we continued south to St.Ives which was very pretty, a credit to its namesake in Cornwall. There was just enough room for us to moor after we had nudged a rowing boat out of the way. It had been padlocked in place and there was a notice on it demanding that the owner remove it as it was illegally moored, so we didn't feel too guilty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After lunch and a little look around we moved on to overnight in Huntingdon, stopping briefly on the way to sit out a thunderstorm.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leaving Huntingdon we continued our travels and at the approach to a lock we passed a sign telling the upstream traffic to turn right. Confused, we almost missed the sign pointing us to the left for the navigation channel. We jerked Liberty Belle to the left and followed the channel, glimpsing the lock to our right on the way around an island in a circuitous route to the lock entrance. Tony looked it up and saw that we were allowed to go either way, but immediately right would have been quicker and put us in a better position to go straight in. Oh well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following day we stopped at St. Neots for lunch, alongside a park with shady trees... it was so hot that we sat in the shade and stayed for the rest of the day. We are not very good in the heat...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stretch of river on the way into Bedford is absolutely beautiful and there were a lot of people appreciating it on paddle boards and in kayaks, so we took things steadily. It was just as well because there were also scullers zooming about without checking behind them. 
We arrived in Bedford and found some shady trees nearby, thank goodness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leaving Bedford we went to the end of navigation, turned and became grounded in the process. A very nice man who was jogging past, stopped to talk to us and ended up wielding our barge pole and pushing us free of the silt. Above and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the next few days we went back the way we had come, dodging the thunder storms and scullers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We stopped for the night at St. Neots again, mooring as close to Waitrose as we could in order to re-fill our cupboards. Tony managed to trip up with the help of a short piece of rope and fell to his knees leaving a proper school boy style graze on his knee. That night he had very little sleep because our mooring was also the place of choice for two young men to drink into the night, getting so drunk that Tony was worried about them falling into the river. He kept an eye on them until they had successfully struggled their way up the ramp from the pontoon - apparently it was quite a performance!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Just Tony's size!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We finally reached Ely again, squeezing ourselves into the last mooring space, which had been vacated moments before we arrived.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ahead of us was the re-crossing of the tidal section of the River Great Ouse, which Tony had booked, and more of the Middle Levels...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;27th July - 3rd August 2020&lt;/h2&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Moored in March.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;(The town of March)&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stanground Lock is the entrance to the Middle Levels, a section of drains between the River Nene and the River Great Ouse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although people have been trying to keep the sea out of this area since the 1400's, Dutch engineers were employed to design and build drains in the 1640's to enable the surrounding land to be used for agriculture and for navigation by 49 foot long commercial boats called Fen Lighters, which would take cargoes across the Fens to and from bigger sea-going vessels. The Middle Level Commissioners, established in 1754, maintain the drains and many have now been altered to allow the passage of longer narrow boats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n83/20200728-P1320312.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;2&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The new windlass sold to us at Stanground Lock is for these shrouded spindles.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n83/20200728-P1320314.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;3&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Yes, it works!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to the inevitably flat terrain, we had the same view for miles;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;wind turbines, being put to very good use in all the wind;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;a huddle of trees dominated by poplars, with a house nestled behind them;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;a pumping station in a low brick building with nest boxes attached;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;a very low bridge (maybe the locals wouldn't know how to deal with the gradient of the humpback version).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we passed each feature, another, almost identical, would appear on the horizon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n83/20200729-P1320417.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;4&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;A wind turbine forest.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;One of the many very low bridges.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only flowers we saw were waterlilies, bindweed and the occasional clump of poppies. Sometimes we would see a swan, a black headed gull or a fistful of swifts, or maybe even a cormorant or a cloud of starlings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only human witnesses to our passage had to be looking through a first floor window, walking across a bridge or watching from a cherry picker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was all strangely mesmerising and peaceful until suddenly the RAF would roar into action overhead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n83/20200729-P1320419cropped.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;8&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;It was obvious to me, from watching this bird, that cormorants weren't built to walk along wires.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n83/20200803-P1320875cropped.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;9&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Although RAF planes were often around, I didn't manage to get a decent photo but the American Airforce was much slower....&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We travelled in this way along Whittlesey Dyke to the town of Whittlesey, then through Ashline Lock onto the Old Nene to the town of March.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n83/20200727-P1320297.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;10&quot; /&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;We arrived in Whittlesey to find the pontoon was full so we moored nearby and were grateful for our gangplank.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The official advice was to contact the keeper at Marmont Priory Lock to book passage through to Well Creek. This Tony did and was given a slot at 12:45 which meant we had a bit too much time really, but it was just as well as we travelled most of the way behind a hire boat which was moving so slowly that it felt rather like a slow bicycle race.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, we arrived in plenty of time and moored up at the very short and inadequate pontoon. The boat ahead of us was already rising in the lock. Some time passed and another hire boat arrived. As there was no room for them to moor we took their ropes and put them alongside us. Meanwhile there was plenty of frantic activity and raised voices from the lock ahead. One woman shouted down to us that she was about to open the sluices on the lock gates so we had all better move well back. This put the other hire boat crew into confusion but I suggested that we would be fine where we were. The sluices opened very slowly and the water began to seep out... The water continued to seep out for rather longer than we would have expected, so Tony went up to investigate. He found that the paddles in the top gate had not been closed properly, so the water was passing straight through. He rectified this and the lock finally finished emptying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because the second boat was tied to us, we let them use the lock before us.
Tony went along to help them through and I made us a quick lunch before joining them.
By now our allotted time had been and gone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To check on progress, I approached the lock as an elderly woman was struggling up the steps. She introduced herself as the lock keeper and said she was going to fetch her grand-daughter before helping us, on Liberty Belle, through the lock as arranged.
What? We had helped two hire boats through, who had no idea what they were doing and she had held back until it was our turn! I was flabbergasted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Off she went in her car and Tony and I helped the hire boat though and started emptying the lock whilst we had some lunch then took ourselves through. Just as we were about to leave the lock, the lock keeper and her granddaughter turned up and said they would wind down the last paddle for us. She was eager to chat and I knew Tony was waiting to pick me up. I gathered from what she told me as I backed up the path, that the hire boats were supposed to have been behind us, so she was planning to let them through after she had assisted us. No-one else seemed to be aware of that. I think her system needs a little tweaking...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our next booking was through the Salters Lode Lock to cross the tidal section of the River Great Ouse and exit through Denver Lock. It was a short distance but we only had a very brief window of opportunity to get from one to the other and the whole process has to be carefully coordinated by the lock keepers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two possible problems, getting swept out to sea at Kings Lynn or coming aground (then later either sinking or being swept out to sea at Kings Lynn).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, we were ready and waiting at our allotted time to follow instructions to the letter... It was a slow process but the lock keeper was cheerful and entertaining. Whilst we were waiting for the all clear from Denver Lock he explained that we should expect a narrow boat coming towards us and a floating pontoon in the mouth of the Denver lock that we should try to avoid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we exited the lock we were facing down river so had to turn very sharply towards the lock, upstream of us. We waved to the other boat and nipped around the pontoon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Success!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, we had taken note of the very difficult angle we would have to negotiate to get back into the Salters Lode Lock on our return journey. That may not be quite so straight forward...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Waiting patiently for the go-ahead to cross the tidal river to Denver Lock&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the Middle Levels we had the River Great Ouse and its tributaries, Wissey, Little Ouse and Lark to explore, but first we took the opportunity to visit Downham Market, which was just a lock and a few miles away along the River Great Ouse Relief Channel. We didn't realise how slow the lock was going to be or indeed how slow the people using it ahead of us were... It was painful to watch but we remained upbeat and luckily found a mooring just where we had hoped to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Returning from Downham Market and re-entering the lock through to the River Great Ouse.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rivers are beautiful and were shown to their best advantage in the sunshine. The water was usually so clear that we were able to watch the fish darting about amongst the weed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We saw more variety in the flowers along the banks, there were dragonflies in great numbers along with butterflies and an abundance of thistledown!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were heron and Great Crested Grebes stationed at regular intervals, cormorants and terns were plentiful, as were the acrobatic swallow and house martin display teams. Swans and ducks were out in force, especially around the towns and villages where bread was in plentiful supply. There were geese everywhere, some of which began to take to the skies in typical V-shaped formation. Also spotted were Common Sandpipers, a group of which flew in front of the boat for quite some time one afternoon and gave me an opportunity to see them close up. We were spoilt by so many kingfisher sightings, each one a delight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hoped to moor at the end of each tributary and explore locally. At the end of the River Wissey was Stoke Ferry, then Brandon at the end of the Little Ouse. We didn't quite get into Brandon to moor because the last lock was far too short! It must be one of those left at their original length. We discovered this when I realised I wouldn't be able to close the gates. Tony had to do the reverse of shame, turn and moor near the lock, trying to avoid all the youngsters jumping into the river and swimming around near the lock and pontoon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We walked the short distance into Brandon for a look around, then returned along the Little Ouse.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;When we arrived at our desired mooring place there wasn't much room left so we had to do our best with long ropes and gangplanks.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On one particular day on the River Lark, we had already seen several kingfishers flashing from tree to tree along the length of the river, as they do, when we ran out of trees along the bank. Suddenly, there was a kingfisher, hovering several feet above the water in front of the boat. It stayed there for a considerable amount of time, suspended in the sunlight, before it dived and then flew off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was absolutely magical, like a flashing blue lantern leading the way. Presumably, having no overhanging branches in its territory from which to perch and watch for prey, it had learnt to hover above the river. Now that's something we will never forget.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n83/20200803-P1320856.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;42&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;That'll do nicely.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n83/IMG_20200802_155836975.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;43&quot; /&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;A tricky turn outside Jude's Ferry, over a sunken bathtub.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back on the main river, which, after some of the narrow sections we had done recently, looked enormously wide. Our biggest hazard were the scullers, (one of them nursing a drowning sheep), although they were generally very cautious and some even had mirrors to check behind them. How sensible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We arrived in Ely, which is beautiful, so we decided to stay for a visit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Happy Anniversary!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another year has passed since we purchased Liberty Belle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My goodness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In those two years we have weathered all kinds of weather and completed 2635 miles and 2014 locks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/maps/Year1-2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Our route&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The map of our journey so far.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were wondering what we could tell you in this special anniversary edition because, contrary to popular belief, I don't like to repeat myself too much... Then we had an email from Aub, (Liberty Belle's Fishing Consultant and possibly our most avid reader), posing a few questions. Perfect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will do our best to answer them but please bear in mind that this is what we think today, in this moment. Ask us again, another day, and we might well say something else...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;When was the first morning you woke up and realised you had embarked on something quite special and couldn’t wait for the adventure to unfold?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, I think we feel like this every time we have a new stretch of the network ahead of us, but the first time must have been the day we set off through our first set of locks. We had loaded our own belongings into Liberty Belle a couple of days before, Tarka and I had spent the first night under the M1 and a day in the pouring rain cleaning and finding homes for all our posessions whilst we waited for Tony to join us after taking back the hire van. We woke up to sunshine, cheerful lock keepers and the pretty Watford Locks with the whole network of canals and rivers ahead of us!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n82/20180825-DSCN0452.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;2&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Watford Locks&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;What has been the best bit so far?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This should be a very difficult one, there have been so many and such varied highlights, however, we both agree that Yorkshire is the best. (Garry will be pleased).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's not just the fabulous scenery, which is undeniable, or the well kept canals and locks but also the friendliness, camaraderie and humour of the people, of all backgrounds and ages. They were out in force, in family groups and friendship groups, walking, jogging, cycling or just watching the world go by but always chatting amongst themselves. Dad and son discussing politics in the bar, Dad and daughter out for an ice-cream, Mum and the kids walking miles uphill to visit a 'beach', Dad and the kids walking over the hill to the railway station after spending the night together under canvas, groups of retired men that have known each other for years just meeting up for a walk, three generations of a family out on their bikes. Joggers didn't just rush by, they smiled, stopped, asked how you were. It's a different world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n82/20190801-P1250951.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;3&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;A little snippet of Yorkshire.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;The most difficult bit?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Kennet and Avon, especially through Reading. If you need lessons in making life difficult for boaters, ask Reading, they know.
&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n82/20190414-P4140898.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;4&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;&quot;I'll go as slowly as I can and you lean out and press the button...&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;The most frightening bit?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, the two locks where Liberty Belle nearly sank are the obvious answers, but, in a way, the more frightening times are when we have a chance to worry about them beforehand, like tidal bits of rivers. The Thames for one, and the River Great Ouse for another. (You won't know about this yet, the story is yet to come!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n82/20200322-P1300188.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;5&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Here we go!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;The most satisfying bit?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oddly, it was the tidal section of the Thames. Tony was determined that we would do it and I was hoping that I wouldn't have to face it. It took a lot of planning and organising. Tony reassured me that we wouldn't go unless the conditions were perfect and then we went anyway! Being so worried actually heightened our senses, so we were able to appreciate everything, and of course, we had Cathy with us as our calming influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n82/20200322-P1300205.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;6&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Tony looking stoic and Cathy looking calm.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;The most memorable bit?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have thought a lot about this one and have to cheat by giving several answers. Aside from all the memorable bits above, we would have to say:-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bristol. We like Bristol as a city anyway but it was amazing to be able to moor right outside the cafe that Cathy was managing and have so many members of the family together on the boat at once. It was rather special.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n82/20190428-P4281219.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;7&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Out to play in Bristol with Mary and Joe.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n82/20190429-P4291247.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;8&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Leaving Bristol with Cathy as skipper.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paddington. The moorings in Paddington are modern, neat and bustling. Being right outside the railway station was very convenient for exploring London. We were so chuffed to be able to moor there for a whole week and explore the city at our own pace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n82/IMG-20190525-WA0001.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;9&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Moored outside Paddington Station.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Liverpool docks. Mooring in Liverpool docks meant we actually became part of the city's attractions. We were able to explore the city from our own doorstep, even popping back for lunch if we felt like it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n82/20190911-P1260941.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;10&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Liverpool Docks.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stratford on Avon. Again, here, we became part of the attraction and were able to explore the area at our leisure. Stratford is a place I already liked but I had never before had enough time there to just take it all in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n82/20180927-DSCN0789.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;11&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Stratford On Avon moorings.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;When were you the coldest?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At breakfast time in the winter. This is the basic truth. We don't make a fire in the mornings if we are setting off soon, but even if we do, it takes an hour or so to heat up the boat. We can't use the radiators until the domestic batteries have been charged either by the engine running or by sunshine on the solar panels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n82/IMG-20200129-WA0000.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;12&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Brrrrr....&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Where on the adventure surprised you the most and why?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Golly, we have little surprises almost every day. Here are 3 pleasant ones. Ask us on another day and we will probably give you a different selection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We weren't expecting anything of Bollington, near Macclesfield but I would have moved in. It had lovely old buildings, it was neat, clean, friendly and it had lots of local footpaths through the surrounding countryside with wonderful views.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The town of Tring in the Chilterns was a surprise because, for a small place, it has so much to offer including a Natural History Museum and a country park with walks and trails.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reach is a tiny village in Cambridgeshire and we only stopped there because it was at the end of our navigation and there was a mooring space. We felt obliged to visit, as we were there. It has the Devil's Dyke passing right through the middle of it and apparently has held a fair there every year since 1201 (except, of course, this year. There is no mention of the black death stopping it, but I expect it did.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

Tring Park on Rotumah's back,
dangling lettuce leaves in front
of the tortoise to encourage it
to move.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;On your visits home what do you look forward to the most?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our own flushing toilet and having the chance to catch up with friends, although we are never there long enough to see many people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Do you ever think you would quite happily stay at the house a bit longer?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes. We are always frustrated that we don't get as much done at the house as we had hoped but are always pleased and excited to get back to Liberty Belle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And lastly, some questions that I made up myself because I want to answer them...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;After 2 years travelling around the network, is there anywhere now that feels a bit like home?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Birmingham&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Braunston&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Banbury&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our travels have taken us back to some places several times, but not all of them have the same effect on us. When we approach any one of these three places, we get a thrill of recognition and a cosy feeling of home. Strange but true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Tony, what are the most annoying aspects of the boating life?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Emergency Plumbing - most DIY really but the plumbing jobs tend to be more destructive.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Adjusting the tension on the alternator belts with only two hands (and the heel of one foot) while perched astride a warm or hot engine.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Cold, wet cruising days - we said we wouldn't do this but sometimes you have to and sometimes it starts off ok and then you get caught out!&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Cold mornings wrapped in a blanket waiting for breakfast.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Showering in a cubicle which is too small with ice cold tiles to brush against.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Shaving.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not really a boating problem but shaving on a boat usually involves not quite enough light and water a little cooler than ideal. I remember my dad when he was about my age complaining of the unceasing need to shave every day. I now do the same complaining. The alternative of not shaving doesn't suit me either!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Toilet emptying.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our toilet waste is stored in a plastic cassette, or what has been called a suitcase, which has to be emptied every few days into a suitable disposal point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; This usually consists of a cubicle containing a large stainless steel funnel shaped hole in an easy to clean stainless steel housing. Nearby there is usually a tap which can be used to swish it all clean. There used to be a short hose attached to the tap to enable this to be done efficiently but now, because there is a risk of foul water being syphoned back into the water main, these have mostly been removed making it impossible to clean up properly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consequently there is a 'build up'. If you have ever looked at the nests of pigeons under bridges you will note that each year their nest becomes taller and taller until ultimately they are squashed against the top of the bridge. The cause is similar!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, there is a breed of  boaters who make no attempt to clean up after themselves even if it is possible. As an aside, these smelly cubicles will often contain a sign reading&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;signtranscript&quot;&gt;'Not Drinking Water'&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing has ever been further from my mind!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Rachel, what are the most annoying aspects of the boating life?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Attempting to keep the carpet clean.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Finding somewhere to keep the ever increasing pile of re-cycling whilst we wait for the rare opportunity to put it in an appropriate bin, only to find that someone else has already contaminated the contents.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Arriving at a lock to find that the last boaters abandoned it with the paddles up, so I have to do their job as well as my own.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;If you turn your back on anything in the boat for a short while, it gets incorporated into a spider's web. Items in the drainer, washing, fruit, binoculars....anything. When we bought Liberty Belle she came complete with several bottles of 'No More Spiders', something I had never heard of and would never use. I thought the previous owners must have had a phobia but now I understand.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Tony, what are your favourite things about this boating life?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Moving off from our moorings on a crisp sunny morning.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Sitting cosily under a duvet with a coal fire.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Finding a beautiful, secure mooring with bollards or rings just where you wanted it to be.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Eating the lovely meals that Rachel creates daily.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Eating fried up jacket potatoes cooked overnight in the embers of the coal fire (or sometimes incinerated..).&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Discovering, unexpectedly, something unusual in a village we are passing through.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Rachel, what are your favourite things about this boating life?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Setting off early in the morning, with the weather in our favour and the whole day to look forward to.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;People waving.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Watching the birds and animals we see along the way.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The silly conversations Tony and I have about what we see as we chug along.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Exploring the places we pass though and finding something fascinating.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Singing to myself as I walk along the towpath, from lock to lock, with no-one to hear me.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;At the end of a long day, feeling tired but happy and ready to settle down in front of the fire.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;There now. I bet you wish you hadn't asked!&lt;/h4&gt;
