&lt;h2&gt;20th-27th July 2020&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/maps/n80map.png&quot; alt=&quot;Our route&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Our route&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n80/IMG_20200721_145605262_HDR.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;One of many old mills on the River Nene.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After having had our new fire extinguishers successfully delivered, we moved through the last lock on the Northampton Arm and onto the River Nene. How exciting! It was especially exciting because we hadn't got a proper map, so were not entirely sure where we would have access to moorings or facilities, and we weren't entirely convinced that we had the right equipment to operate the locks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apparently, Nene can be pronounced to rhyme with &quot;pen&quot; (if you are West of Peterborough), or to rhyme with &quot;gene&quot; if you are East of the city. So far we have only heard it pronounced &quot;Nen&quot; once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n80/20200720-P1310984.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;2&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The lock onto the River Nene.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n80/20200720-P1320009.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;3&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The Nene in Northampton.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since he began planning this section of our journey, (back in Henley), Tony has been obsessed with measuring and re-measuring Liberty Belle, to see if we were likely to fit under the bridges on the Middle Levels, between the Nene and the Great Ouse. He had come to the conclusion that we might make it if we have a full tank of water to keep Liberty Belle low enough. Even so, he still keeps measuring...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will need yet another key and a different windlass for the Middle Levels too, but we should be able to purchase them when we get there, so that concern is for another day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The locks on the River Nene are different in that they have a guillotine gate at one end. (We came across one of these in Todmordon and it didn't go well. &lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn1&quot; id=&quot;ref1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n80/20200721-P1320046.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;4&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Liberty Belle faces the guillotine!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In times of flood the guillotine gate is lowered and the upstream lock gates are padlocked open. The guillotine gates are then operated as a sluice gate, letting through as much or as little water as is required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of these gates are operated electronically and to access the control buttons you need a particular key which also opens any padlocks on the gates. Whilst we were moored in Northampton, Tony tested one of Liberty Belle's mystery keys on the padlock attached to the gate of our first Nene Lock. It fitted! He also checked that one of our many windlasses fitted, which it did. Excellent. That saved us from having to manoeuvre Liberty Belle in and out of the Northampton Marina before we left, to buy them. (We tried accessing the marina on foot but couldn't find our way in.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n80/IMG_20200722_122102486.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;4&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Most of the Nene guillotine lock gates are operated using one of these control panels...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n80/IMG_20200722_154417737_HDR.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;5&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;...but others require more physical effort.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, fully equipped for the next leg of the journey, we were off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The River Nene is absolutely beautiful and the weather showed it off at its best. We watched cormorants, heron, terns, an occasional kingfisher and even an oyster catcher. I decided that if I couldn't see a Red Kite at any point, I simply wasn't trying hard enough, there were so many.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n80/20200721-P1320010.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;6&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Leaving Northampton behind and...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;...passing through the automatic flood gates.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n80/20200723-P1320172.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;10&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;A different style, but equally pretty bridge.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n80/20200723-P1320179.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;11&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Many of the locks have lovely old mill buildings next to them. Many, like this one, have found new uses but others are derelict.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n80/20200721-P1320033.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;12&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;A bit of quality family time.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n80/IMG-20200722-WA0006.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;13&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Ditchford Lock is the last of the traditional radial locks on the Nene. The gate is curved and swings in an arc when opening and closing.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n80/20200723-P1320182.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;14&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Wow! Just!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n80/20200722-P1320111.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;15&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Apparently iris leaves are very tasty indeed. We later saw a goat trying to eat them too.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately our plan to stop off to explore the towns and villages on the way didn't come to much because the moorings were either non-existent, surrounded by private land with no access, or already full of boats (or boat, singular). This meant that we had long days sitting on the back of the boat with beautiful views but no breaks. So, despite the river turning out to be much longer than we thought and winding with sharp bends, we still made good time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n80/20200721-P1320066.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;16&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Yes, we are members.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;It was very, very long...!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;We had a little look around the village.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The mooring at Thrapston. It was tricky to approach. There wasn't enough room for us. It was trickier still to reverse away.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n80/20200723-P1320168.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;25&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Lovely lunchtime mooring. This one was tricky too but only because the strong wind was against us.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the 23rd, after a long day of searching for an overnight mooring, we arrived in Fotheringhay where we stopped at Castle Farm, which we had hoped to avoid because we knew there would be an overnight charge. However, it wan't expensive so we decided to stay for two nights to give us a chance to explore the local area on foot. We found a circular walk, taking in the villages of Nassington, (where we had a flask of coffee and biscuits), Yarwell Mill where there was a lockside cafe that it would be rude to ignore, so we stopped for tea and cake, then the village of Elton, where we had a pint in the pub garden followed by our picnic on a bench on the green. Quite a nice day!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst we were walking through Nassington we came across a notice board in someone's front garden. It was shaped like a stork carrying a bundle, and on it was announced the birth of twins a few days before. As we were admiring it an elderly gentleman on the other side of the road shouted over to us that the twins had brought down the average age of the villagers to 98! Hehehe!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Yarwell Junction railway station. Normally, steam trains run between here and  Peterborough.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst in Fotheringhay, Tony booked passage through the lock in Peterborough that would take us from the River Nene onto The Middle Level Navigations. This is operated by a lock keeper and at least 24 hours notice needs to be given. We were given a slot for 10 a.m. on Monday morning, which would give us the weekend in Peterborough. We hoped we would find a suitable mooring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following day we set off for Peterborough, stopping off at the Yarwell Mill Lock for bacon butties from the lockside cafe....!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n80/20200725-P1320233.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;32&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;This is the temporary lock landing at Yarwell Mill, where there is a cafe...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;On one side of the  river it says &quot;County of Huntingdon&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;On the other it says &quot;County of Soke of Peterborough&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We finally arrived in Peterborough to find that there was enough mooring space for a fleet! We decided not to bunch in with the boats nearest the town because one of them seemed to have a loud party going on already at 3 in the afternoon, so we gave ourselves a bit of space and moored a little further along.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n80/20200727-P1320278.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;38&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Our Peterborough mooring.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Long, long ago, when I was a schoolgirl, we had lived in Stamford, a town near Peterborough, and Mary has kept in touch with a couple who still live there. I arranged to meet up with them whilst we were in the area and they seemed keen to see Liberty Belle. It was lovely to have a good old natter about the past and this 'n' that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also took our chance to do some shopping and visit Peterborough Cathedral. It is an interesting town with lots of history but the museum was closed so we felt we were missing out. The Cathedral is a dramatic and beautiful building but we did feel that the visit was dampened by the wearing of masks, steamed up glasses, a one way system and hand sanitising stations. All this is necessary and reasonable and we are happy to go along with it but it certainly takes the glory out of things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Monday morning, after filling up with water, we braved the wet and windy weather to keep our appointment with the lock keeper, a lovely, chatty lady.  She sold us the required key and windlass, gave us a guide book and sent us on our way, on the new leg of our journey, with a smile, a little advice and a cheerful wave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;6th - 20th July 2020&lt;/h2&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Robin at the helm.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After our week at the house, Robin kindly loaded us back into his car and returned us to Liberty Belle, waiting patiently for us in Thrupp. Without delay we left our mooring and soon discovered that Robin was still on board, so we gave him the job of helmsman all the way to Banbury.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the way we searched for otters, crayfish and a pub serving beer. (Two out of three ain't bad...)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n79/20200709-P1310877.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;2&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Concentrating...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Tony taking a turn at operating the locks.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We did a bit of gongoozling at a lock whilst out for a short walk and spotted a small ring on the right hand side of the bow of a narrow boat, which puzzled us. Robin questioned the owner who said it was for springing the boat which he suggested involved roping either the stern or the bow to a post when turning. I asked why there wasn't another ring on the other side of the bow, to which he had no answer. This of course set the boys off searching for information on 'springing' a boat and was the topic of conversation for quite some considerable time...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We concluded that the attachment that we had seen was unsuitable for the job the owner had told us it was for. Sometime later we saw another boat with the same attachment. This owner told us it was for tying on the anchor. Now that sounds more plausible. He also suggested that every narrow boat has a specific fixture for this purpose. Hmmm, Liberty Belle, you seem to be lacking in that department.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During this part of our journey, there was a small incident involving our radio aerial and a low bridge, which, despite the fact that it could have happened to any of us at any time, Tony will never let Robin forget...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some time later, as Tony was driving, a small overhanging oak twig brushed along the top of the boat and got caught under one of the solar panels, bringing down the enormous branch that it was attached to! Carnage!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n79/20200708-P1310863.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;4&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Oops!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n79/20200709-P1310890.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;5&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Oops again!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the 9th July we had reached Banbury. After Robin had been shown the Banbury Budgies and we had all eaten a Fish &amp;amp; Chip lunch, Robin caught his bus back to his car at Thrupp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We stayed in Banbury for a couple more nights to wait for our annual, (due last February), service of Liberty Belle's fire safety equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the scaffolding for the building site alongside the canal was expanded to include our mooring space, so getting on and off the boat became increasingly difficult. When Ben arrived to service, (or rather, replace), our fire extinguishers, he had muddled us up with another boat and had brought the wrong stuff....so we are now due to meet him again in Northampton.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh well, it had given Tony time to service the engine and install his new and updated wooden fixtures on the boat, for us to have a nice walk locally and for me to do some shopping and cooking for the journey ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n79/20200714-P1310893.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;6&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, as soon as Ben had left, we had lunch, managed to untie from bollards under the scaffolding and went on our way. My goodness it was busy! For some reason we seemed to be going in the opposite direction to most boats, so we didn't have to queue for long at the locks. We were so pleased to be travelling that we chose to spend long days on the move watching the world go by.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meadowsweet was interspersed with the purple of vetch and cranesbill flowers, and the pink of willow herbs, making a beautiful border to the canal. The butterflies and dragonflies were plentiful and the weather mostly sunny and warm as we travelled along the familiar Oxford Canal.  We still spotted the occasional newly hatched brood of ducks or moorhens but alongside all this summer delight were reminders that autumn is around the corner. Some of the young waterbirds were almost indistinguishable from their adults and in the hedgerows the hard, green hips, haws, sloes and elderberries, are biding their time...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we arrived in Napton we were very lucky to find a mooring outside the delightful Folly Inn. As we were ahead of schedule, there was no need to rush off the next day, so we stayed for lunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n79/IMG_20200715_162442688.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;8&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The menu at The Folly. It was the promise of faggots that drew us in!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The Garden of The Folly, all set up for socially distanced dining. It worked very well but just isn't the same as being in a cosy pub.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Napton we turned onto the Grand Onion heading towards Northampton, passing through Braunston and Norton junctions. It was very busy and hard going but fun. The locks were now double width and so we all tried to share locks where we could. Often boats would moor up or other boats would set off so partnerships were made and lost, but we all did what we could to help keep the traffic flowing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was lots of chatter with the usual &quot;Where are you heading for?&quot;, &quot;Where do you hope to moor tonight?&quot; and &quot;How long are you out for?&quot; interspersed with the new &quot;Where were you Locked down?&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n79/20200717-P1310919.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;10&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;We moored briefly at Braunston turn to buy Braunston Bangers. A tradition of ours!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n79/IMG_20200718_100813818_HDR.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;11&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;These traditional mile markers have been replaced, sponsored by various groups and individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n79/IMG_20200718_100916776.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;12&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Tony, back at the helm.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We finally reached Gayton Junction on the 19th and turned onto the Northampton Arm to face the series of 16 locks into Northampton. We were warned by a boater that one of the pounds between the locks was low, so we knew it was going to be slow going. We moored at the top and went to investigate. Three locks down and we could see that the pound was indeed too low to navigate. Between us Tony and I started letting water through from the top of the flight by opening both the top and bottom paddles of each lock until the water was at its normal height.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We then brought Liberty Belle through. Just as we were in the second lock, a Canal &amp;amp; River Trust engineer appeared over the breast of the hill. Apparently, what we had sorted out was the very least of it! He had a completely dry pound at the other end of the flight. He asked us to sit tight for 45 minutes whilst he let more water through all the way to the other end. So, Tony tied Liberty Belle to try to keep her steady as she surfed the wave in the lock and I put the kettle on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n79/20200719-P1310928.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;13&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Liberty Belle surfing the wave as water passes through the lock to fill the pounds below.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once we had the go-ahead we continued our journey, passing only one boat on the way. It was hard work but straightforward. After the locks we noticed we were being followed by a tern, swooping and diving behind the boat for a considerable time. Liberty Belle must have been stirring up the fish for him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n79/20200719-P1310965cropped.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;15&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Our tern swooping...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n79/20200719-P1310959cropped.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;16&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;...and diving.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We finally arrived at our destination, only to find that the mooring space was full! We ended up having to reverse back along the canal but Liberty Belle was very well behaved and it proved to be more simple than we had thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tony then proceeded to collect all the dog mess from the vicinity of the boat, to make our visit more pleasant. After he had collected four very full bags and we were settling in, one of the moored boats moved off. We untied and moved forwards again into his space. Oh well, that was Tony's good deed for the week!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here Liberty Belle's old Fire Extinguishers were finally exchanged for new ones and we were ready, (maybe), for our trip on the River Nene!
But that's another story...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Footnotes:-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;fn1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;The Salt Way is part of an ancient track that was used to transport salt from Droitwich to London and the South of England.&lt;a href=&quot;#ref1&quot; title=&quot;Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.&quot;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Where Next?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The River Nene isn't covered by the Collins Canal and River Maps that we normally use on our travels, so Tony has spent a lot of time online trying to gather information about the river, its locks and the facilities available to boaters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He joined the Friends of the River Nene some months ago in anticipation of our journey. We have discovered that one of the mystery keys we have had on board all along opens the padlocks and operating consoles along the river and that our collection of windlasses should be sufficient until we get to the mysterious Middle Levels. We have decided to deal with them when we get there...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are currently heading for Peterborough. Sadly, the lock that allows access to the tidal section of the River Nene, and ultimately to The Wash, is out of order. Phew!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rachel Glombek</name></author><category term="LibertyBelle" /><summary type="html">From Thrupp to Northampton 6th - 20th July 2020</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Close Encounters of the Bovine Kind</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/libertybellenewsletter/libertybelle/2020/07/20/close-encounters-of-the-bovine-kind.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Close Encounters of the Bovine Kind" /><published>2020-07-20T20:38:00+01:00</published><updated>2020-07-20T20:38:00+01:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/libertybellenewsletter/libertybelle/2020/07/20/close-encounters-of-the-bovine-kind</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/libertybellenewsletter/libertybelle/2020/07/20/close-encounters-of-the-bovine-kind.html">&lt;h2&gt;From Henley to Thrupp&lt;/h2&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Everywhere on the Thames!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We left Henley early on the morning of 22nd June in the hope of getting a few miles done before the day was out. As it happened, we were too early for the warden's rounds, so some might say, rather unkindly, that we did a moonlight flit...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The surrounding crash barriers suggest we have a good chance of hitting this bridge...
&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the next few days we made our way along the Thames to Lechlade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our progress was slowed by:-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;a small boat closing a lock door in our faces and leaving us behind;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;a lock that was out of order and couldn't be operated. (After calling the appropriate number several times we were eventually rescued by a friendly local lock keeper);&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;the narrow and winding nature of the Thames above Oxford. (It almost turns back on itself at times);&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;the shear number of people playing in the cool water. (Around every corner there was someone jumping in, paddling, rowing or just drifting along on an inflatable).&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the sun shone, the river was pretty and we were all in a holiday mood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All except for the single sculler who suddenly changed course and steered directly into our bow. We were travelling as slowly as we could, having come out of a lock to find ourselves surrounded by people having fun in the water in various ways. He was extremely cross with us. I have no idea what he could have expected us to do...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Old Father Thames has been Grade II listed.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;He was made for Crystal Palace, then moved to the source of the Thames, but he has retired to St. John's Lock.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We reached Lechlade at lunch time of the 25th June, found a mooring alongside a field and went straight to the Fish &amp;amp; Chip shop which had been mentioned by someone earlier in the day and had played on our minds ever since.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we returned to the boat it was too hot to sit inside, so we arranged our chairs outside and created some shade with an umbrella and some towels. We relaxed there briefly before we were stirred into action by strange sounds behind us, which turned out to be cows attempting to taste the towels!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet again, thanks to my Mother's NVQ Level 1 Cattle Herding Course, I knew exactly what to do and leapt into action. Drawing myself up as large as I could and using the umbrella &lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn1&quot; id=&quot;ref1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; for extra dramatic effect, I told them in a firm and dominant voice that they were to move immediately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually, in their own time, in a rather indifferent manner, they wandered off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to cool off by going for a swim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems that the herd of cows wander around the edge of the field, returning to the moorings several times a day to see if the ropes are edible or the sides of the boats taste good when licked.... According to our neighbour, they begin this routine at 5 a.m. each morning. Hmmmmm...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n78/IMG-20200625-WA0012cropped.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;21&quot; /&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Unwelcome, very inquisitive visitors.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n78/20200625-P1310724.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;22&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;No, the towels are not edible!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n78/20200625-P1310729.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;23&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;We were able to stay immersed for much longer than in Sunbury!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following morning we travelled the short distance to the official turning point which was extremely shallow, making the manoeuvre rather more difficult than it should have been... It was not a good start to the day, but Tony managed to bring Liberty Belle around and we waved goodbye to the herd of cows before heading back along the Thames looking for a shady mooring that we had heard about. Failing to find it, we got as far as Pinkhill Lock before giving up for the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The joy of successfully turning Liberty Belle under difficult circumstances!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the morning the weather had taken a turn. With the sun in hiding, there were no longer people in the water around every corner, so we made better progress. When we reached Isis Lock, the entrance to the Oxford Canal, my heart did a little leap at the sight of the Canal &amp;amp; River Trust signs. The Thames had been exciting and different but now we were back home on the canal and it felt good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shortly afterwards we met a couple taking their narrow boat in the opposite direction, looking forward to leaving the canal behind and getting back onto the Thames...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n78/20200627-P1310801.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;26&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Yay!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Oxford we travelled North to Thrupp, stopping on the way to collect the new hairclippers that Tony had ordered online when I declared, a few days before, that I needed my hair cutting off. The impracticality of long hair had finally tipped me over the edge. 
Once we arrived in Thrupp we squeezed into a 7 day mooring, managing to get all 57 foot 10 inches of Liberty Belle into a 50 foot space. Then Tony wielded the new hairclippers and I was liberated!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Robin kindly came to Thrupp to collect us and a car full of our stuff, then took us back to the house where the washing machine, sewing machine, lawn mower and woodworking tools were fully employed. Tony planted out his many, many willow plants that had been growing like mad in their washing-up bowls on the boat. He had collected them before lockdown, with a view to making a living willow structure back at the house. Fingers crossed that they survive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We managed to visit Mary, (after some difficulty trying to use one of Eastleigh's car club cars), and fitted in some socially distanced visits with some of our lovely neighbours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the last minute Tony discovered a small water leak in the loft which we thought might cause us to delay our return, but he fixed it and all was well...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having not received an email complaining about Liberty Belle bursting out of her mooring space, we had made good use of our 7 (8?) days before Robin returned us to the boat. Thanks Robin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Where Next?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After much thought, investigation and discussion, we decided that we ought to trim down our travelling plans for this year. We were hoping to get back to Yorkshire before the winter but have decided that would be far too ambitious. We are now planning to go to Northampton and follow the River Nene to Peterborough, then move on to Cambridge. Once we have completed the navigations in that area we will return to the Oxford Canal then the Ashby, hopefully arriving in Birmingham in early September.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rachel Glombek</name></author><category term="LibertyBelle" /><summary type="html">From Henley to Thrupp 21st June - 6th July 2020</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Wey Hey!</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/libertybellenewsletter/libertybelle/2020/06/27/wey-hey.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Wey Hey!" /><published>2020-06-27T22:21:00+01:00</published><updated>2020-06-27T22:21:00+01:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/libertybellenewsletter/libertybelle/2020/06/27/wey-hey</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/libertybellenewsletter/libertybelle/2020/06/27/wey-hey.html">&lt;h2&gt;From Hampton Court to Henley, via the River Wey&lt;/h2&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The end of the last newsletter left us at Hampton Court, where we remained, (with a couple of trips to the lock for water), until a nice man knocked on the boat and declared that the mooring charges would resume the following day. We reassured him that we had been expecting it to happen...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The gates used to shut off the road and allow horses to race across during Hurst Park Racecourse meetings. The tarmac would be covered in peat and grass cuttings to simulate the 'feel' of the rest of the course.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sunken boat beyond Sunbury Lock had been lifted and our way was now clear but we hadn't yet had our long awaited fish and chips from 'The Red Herring' in Sunbury.... As far as we remembered the chip shop didn't open until Wednesday, so we had a couple of days to kill. We decided to travel further back down river to Kingston and top up our supplies from the conveniently positioned Waitrose there. That done, we spent our allocated single night there and then moved to the opposite side of the river for another night, then off back to Sunbury, where our old mooring was waiting and our fish &amp;amp; chip supper didn't disappoint!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n77/IMG_20200606_113242850.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;4&quot; /&gt;

 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n77/IMG_20200606_115526136.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;5&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;...then towed to a local boatyard.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once we had passed through Sunbury lock (and over the sunken boat site) our first task was to get some fuel from Shepperton Marina. Phew, that was a relief.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our next move wasn't quite as obvious. After the sunken boat site was the junction with the River Wey which has the Basingstoke Canal branching off it. We had always hoped to spend a reasonable amount of time exploring this area and, as it is the nearest part of the network to our home ground, we assumed we would catch up with visitors and travel to the house for a while. Work was being carried out on the section of the Wey between Guildford and Godalming and was due to re-open 'mid-June', so there was a chance that we would time that right. However, the Basingstoke Canal was closed. Tony had contacted the appropriate people and pleaded his case. As the government guidance didn't allow for overnight stays anywhere and they had no continuous cruisers on the Basingstoke Canal, there was no reason for it to be opened. Apparently they were not going to do a risk assessment of the entire canal just for us....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The alternative was to pass by the Wey and continue up to Lechlade, leaving the Wey and Basingstoke Canal for another time. We had a feeling that if we took this option, it might never be convenient to return.
We had been told by several people how beautiful the river was, so it would be a shame to by-pass it altogether.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, having decided to travel on the river, we had to purchase the appropriate temporary license from the National Trust, the owners of the navigation. Three days would be sufficient for quick visit to Guildford and back, but a week would enable us to have a socially-distanced visit or two, and there was a chance that the section to Godalming would open in the meantime. If the Basingstoke Canal suddenly opened, we would purchase the separate pass for there, and then pay an extra day for the journey from the canal, along the river, back to the Thames.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good, we finally had a plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n77/20200612-P1310063.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;6&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Welcome to the River Wey Navigation.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Our River Wey weekly pass.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our week passed by quickly. The river was indeed beautiful, meandering its way through fields lined with trees. The locks were well maintained, (as one would expect from the National Trust), and generally easy to operate. We did however, have to borrow a windlass from the lock keeper because the locking mechanism is very slightly different... It's never straight forward.
The towpaths were quiet; the local wildlife were busy feeding their young; swallows and terns were scooting about around us; Red Kites soaring above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had the scent of meadowsweet on the breeze and glimpses of purple vetch along the banks. Yellow waterlilies were everywhere but as I tried to photograph them they dived underwater,  as if camera-shy. As Liberty Belle pushed through the water, it rushed past her sides and temporarily engulfed the flowers. The presence of so much vegetation in the water was an indication of how shallow it was, and we did indeed come aground on one of the many sharp bends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Excitingly, we did have some visitors whilst we were there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joe and Kirsty caught up with us when we were moored outside a pub that was selling takeaway food and beer. My goodness, that was good from every aspect!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Carol found us in Guildford, a place she knows well, and Tony was subjected to us having a long-awaited catch-up! (He assures us that he enjoyed it too.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was no sign of us being able to take Liberty Belle along the stretch to Godalming, so we decided to complete it on foot and Robin caught up with us there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our week was nearly up; we had just 2 days to head back. As we rejoined the Thames, the section of river from Guildford to Godalming was declared open! Oh, fiddlesticks. Rumour has it though, that the repair to the navigation might not hold, so we could have been caught in Godalming and stranded there indefinitely. Perhaps it was for the best that we had missed it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tony has promised that we can travel the Basingstoke Canal by kayak sometime. I am still deciding whether that's a good idea or not...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the junction we passed back onto the Thames, travelling through places that we know, at a faster pace this time because nothing is open. As I write this we are back in Henley. We arrived  after a long day's travel. Tony did battle with the mooring pay machine and lost (or rather, won, as it didn't manage to take his money), but then the warden came around the following morning. It seems that the machine rarely works, so they leave people to fight with it until they give up in anger and frustration, then pay a chap to go from boat to boat taking money and writing mooring tickets out by hand. Modern technology at its finest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Where Next?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have arrived in Oxford now and are going to find a suitable mooring before heading back to the house for a few days to get some jobs done. We won't be doing much socialising, even at a distance, because we want to visit Mary.
When we get back to Liberty Belle, we plan to follow the whole length of the Oxford Canal, then venture onto the Ashby Canal, (Keith's favourite!)&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rachel Glombek</name></author><category term="LibertyBelle" /><summary type="html">From Hampton Court to Henley, via the River Wey 4th - 21st June 2020</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">One banana at a time…</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/libertybellenewsletter/libertybelle/2020/06/04/one-banana-at-a-time.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="One banana at a time..." /><published>2020-06-04T16:47:00+01:00</published><updated>2020-06-04T16:47:00+01:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/libertybellenewsletter/libertybelle/2020/06/04/one-banana-at-a-time</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/libertybellenewsletter/libertybelle/2020/06/04/one-banana-at-a-time.html">&lt;h2&gt;Sunbury to Hampton&lt;/h2&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello again. We hope you are all well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like everyone else we have been in lockdown, allowed to undertake only essential journeys, which for us means trips to the nearest water tap and toilet emptying facility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have explored the local area on foot, queued outside the local supermarkets, drunk a lot of tea, (interspersed with coffee to make a change), and eaten rather more than we should.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n76/IMG_20200424_104434228.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;2&quot; /&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;A very smart welcome sign.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time has behaved very strangely for us both, not helped by the weather being the same, day after day. On our journey we have always had a little trouble knowing what day it is, but this lockdown has caused us to question the month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of our more reliable ways of marking the passage of time is by banana. Every morning we have a bowl of muesli topped with half a banana each. Every time we go shopping we buy more bananas, and so it goes on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n76/P1300800.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;17&quot; /&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Well, they might be useful, if we want to steam up our glasses and be very short of breath.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Soon it became time for me to wear the tea cosy and...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usually, as we travel along, we find convenient places to buy gas for the cooker or to do our laundry. We did need such services but we were stuck. Thankfully we found a launderette and a Calor Gas seller that would collect and deliver, despite us having no address. Sorted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n76/IMG-20200430-WA0000.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;23&quot; /&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Clean bedclothes.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Fab!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the surrounding wildlife have just been getting on with things -&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;crowding for bread, (some people turn up in the park with several whole packets of sliced bread to throw into the water!);&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;shitting, (pardon my language), on everything;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;fighting amongst themselves;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;producing young.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n76/IMG_20200413_153547_471.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;25&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;This pair didn't breed this spring.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;They were probably too busy constantly eating the offerings of bread.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n76/P1300729.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;26&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Our busy little squirrel emptied the contents of the bin most days.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have a particularly aggressive swan at the moorings in Lower Sunbury, our bully-in-residence. He has a mate sitting on a nest at the opposite end of the moorings to us and he patrols the area near our boat, quite some distance from the nest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He is particularly keen on threatening a family of Greylag Geese. He separates them and then chases the male. Cunningly the male leads the swan away from his family towards the end of a pontoon and amongst the boats where the space between them decreases and the swan is eventually unable to follow. Meanwhile the female reassembles her young and leads them in the opposite direction, under the pontoon and meets up with the male there. The swan appears to think his job is temporarily done and leaves them alone for a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On another occasion our bully attacked a visiting female swan. He smacked her head against our boat and then drove her into the mud under a bush behind us. He sat on her, pushing her deep into the mud. We were convinced he had killed her but she eventually showed signs of life, and slowly began to lever herself out of the mud using her beak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back at the nest, there were plenty of visiting geese that didn't get any attention from him because he was too far away to notice!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People came to the park every day to look over the fence at the swan's nest below. For weeks she sat there on her 7 eggs. At last, one morning, 2 chicks were visible in the nest. The following day we went to look over at them on our way out of the park for our walk. What a shock. The two swans were sitting around the nest, with one unhatched egg, one dead chick and no sign of any of the others. So sad. We wondered whether the male swan's aggression extended towards his own chicks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the moments between cups of tea, we have done a few jobs to smarten Liberty Belle up a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In particular, Tony has touched up her paintwork where it was most needed. We already had some paint on board that the previous owners had left behind, but not enough to get the whole job done. Karen, Jon and the boys, who live in this area, very kindly received paint parcels for us and delivered them to the mooring, (in a socially distancing way, of course).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many, many thanks to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Won't she look smart when we are released?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Officially the canal system has been open for journeys since 1st of June. However, things are not quite that simple...there is a another obstacle between us and freedom. Just beyond Sunbury Lock, a widebeam boat, (like Liberty Belle but twice the width), has sunk and is blocking passage along the river.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Picking through all the rumours and reports we have heard and seen about the incident, some of which are contradictory, we have surmised that the boat &lt;em&gt;somehow&lt;/em&gt; became sucked against the barrier across the top of the weir and remained there for &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; number of weeks. Then &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; caused the boat to move and it broke through the barrier and began to sink. The Environment Agency got involved then because it was damaging the weir. They managed to pull it off and back onto the river but it continued to sink. They were unable to lift it because the water levels were too high at the time for it to be done safely, so they attached a buoy to mark its position and declared that section of the river to be temporarily closed. That was on the 6th March. Until recently, the lockdown has prevented a team from working on it. However, a survey has now been completed with a view to removing it soon.... We await further news.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n76/IMG_20200519_142828971.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;40&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Underneath those buoys is a widebeam boat.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime we decided to have a change of scenery and move back down river to Hampton Court, where the mooring charges are being waived for the time being.

&lt;p&gt;So, here we are, outside Hampton Court Palace, opposite the popular Thames Ditton Beach, people watching. On this busy stretch of river, every kind of water craft passes by, from very humble inflatables to showy gin palaces, some of which dwarf poor Liberty Belle!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will move back to Lower Sunbury in a couple of days, (because there are rumours that the long awaited opening of the fish and chip shop has actually happened), then escape as soon as we get the go-ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Where Next?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All being well, we hope to travel along the River Wey and Basingstoke Canal next, before visiting Lechlade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep safe, everyone. xx&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;23rd March 2020 onwards&lt;/h2&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Our mooring in Sunbury.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There we were in Kingston Upon Thames as the restrictions for limiting the virus were coming into effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cathy managed to book herself a train journey from Kingston on Thames for the morning after we arrived there. Luckily she made it home before the lockdown came into effect and avoided being stranded with us. A holiday is one thing, but that might have been a step too far for her!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After waving Cathy off, we joined the socially distanced queue outside Waitrose and stocked up on groceries. Then we went for a walk, following the Thames to Richmond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Walking down Richmond Hill.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We stayed a second night in Kingston and then moved on to Sunbury. On the way a moored boater shouted a warning that the lock we were approaching was closed due to a sunken boat blocking passage. Oh heck! He managed to pass on directions to some pleasant 24 hour moorings at the edge of a tiny public park. That was good of him because the mooring on the lock approach was full.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it happened, the following morning we received instructions from the Canal &amp;amp; River Trust and the Environment Agency to stop moving, along with the news that all mooring restrictions were now lifted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the terms of our 'continuous cruiser' licence we are normally obliged to move regularly, observing the mooring restrictions of up to 14 days in one place and travelling at least 25 miles in a year. This obviously suited us under normal circumstances. Now that the circumstances were far from normal, we were obliged to remain where we were.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We could have chosen at this stage to go back to our house but we have someone living there at the moment so we were concerned about the domino effect that our return would cause. Plus, Liberty Belle is on a mooring where the water levels alter daily and we would have had no way of checking on her for an unknown amount of time. So, with all things considered, we decided to stay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank goodness we didn't wait for a less windy day to travel the tidal section of the Thames, otherwise we would have been in the London Docklands area when we were asked to stop travelling, which may not have been quite as pleasant.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Our nearest bridge over the Thames is Walton Bridge.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;This is the 6th Walton Bridge. Whatever do they do with them?&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course we are allowed to move Liberty Belle to fetch water and to empty the loo...! This involves a 6 mile round trip back to Molesey Lock, where the nearest facilities are. We cannot turn around this side of the lock because there is a danger of getting sucked against the weir, so we have to actually pass through the lock, turn on the other side and go straight back into the lock to operate it again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under normal circumstances, this large lock is electrically operated but now we have to use a wheel and levers which operate it hydraulically. This is to deter people from using it and to lessen the need for a lock keeper to be present.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The once-a-week water ritual seems to take for ever and is no small effort, but we are in no rush...&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;These Egyptian Geese have produced a family, unlike the pair at our mooring.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Two of the many tufted ducks in the area, but none of them come to visit us...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from the concerns that we all have at this time, we also wonder what we will do if we run out of cooking gas or diesel... Having investigated, Tony has located a chap that will deliver gas, so we hope he is still operating when we need him. We think we have enough coal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are safe, comfortable and feeling lucky. We are moored against a narrow public park where people come to feed the ducks, geese and swans. Liberty Belle is positioned at the end of the park where there is no reason for people to walk past us, so we have quite a private section of path at the back of the boat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within walking distance we have a choice of supermarkets, some bins and a few small green spaces. We have a routine of sorts, which mainly revolves around meal times and our 3 o'clock bun!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our boaty neighbour is a friendly chap trying to cope with two dogs that are used to rather more freedom. He takes them to a nearby park where they can take a dip in the river. He is only a short distance from his private moorings which are unfortunately the other side of the sunken boat...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from our human visitors to the park we have a pair each of swans, Egyptian Geese and Mandarin ducks, several parakeets, Canada Geese, Mallards and black headed gulls, and a squirrel to watch, with regular appearances by a Great Crested Grebe, a cormorant, a swimmer, stand-up paddle boarders, kayakers, rowing boats and a chap on a hydroplane board. (A passer-by and I decided the hydroplaner must be James Bond, currently furloughed.) Tony has also seen a kingfisher on several occasions which only goes to prove that he has the best seat in the boat.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Presumably it is quieter there than usual. He's not been seen since, but it doesn't mean he's not there...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know some of you will be busier than you have ever been but if others of you have run out of things to do, you can always read the newsletter archive - just click on the blue button on the top of this email. The archive follows the format of a blog which means the most recent entry is at the top, so, to read them in the correct order, you can click on the word 'Posts' on the top right, then choose the top title, which is the first entry from August 2018. That lot should keep you busy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will send another newsletter when I have anything to report...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No fever to report yet, except maybe a touch of cabin fever...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(If we do catch the virus, I will blame the Tesco shoppers.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have now run out of excuses and have started to address Liberty Belle's rust patches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look after yourselves. Tony and I welcome emails, it would be lovely to hear from you.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Lets just check how it is before we commit ourselves!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;conversationtalk&quot;&gt;&quot;London VTS, this is Narrow Boat Liberty Belle. Over&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;conversationlisten&quot;&gt;&quot;crackle....crackle....narrow bo....hiss...crackle....hiss...&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;conversationtalk&quot;&gt;&quot;London VTS, this is Narrow Boat Liberty Belle. Repeat please. Over&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;conversationlisten&quot;&gt;&quot;crackle....crackle....Liberty Belle...hiss...crackle....hiss...&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;conversationtalk&quot;&gt;&quot;London VTS, this is Liberty Belle. We are a fifty-eight foot narrow boat with three people on board about to enter the River Thames from Limehouse Lock. Out&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n74/P1300169.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;2&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The Limehouse Lock Keeper opens the gates...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With my heart in my mouth, my toes curled and my body tense, (as if on board an out-of-control roller coaster), I stood on the back of Liberty Belle, with Tony and Cathy, as we went through Limehouse Lock and onto the massive River Thames.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tony had the radio clipped to himself, and the instructions for passing under each of the first 29 bridges were printed off, put into plastic wallets and held fast in front of us with a strong magnet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our main concern was an engine breakdown, when we would need to deploy our possibly inadequate anchor. Our boat purchase survey simply noted &quot;There is a small anchor&quot;, which doesn't fill you with confidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was scary but wonderful!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;6th - 21st March 2020&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Our route&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;

 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n73/P1290876cropped.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;At last, I managed to take a photo of a kingfisher!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the train window, on our journey back to Hertford, we could see that the Weeping Willows were declaring the start of spring with their stunningly bright green leaves. Maybe the winter was gradually petering out. Realistically we know that March weather can be tricky, giving you spring one minute and winter the next, so we weren't completely fooled, but it was cheering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We found Liberty Belle as we had left her. Well, almost. A neighbouring boater had moved us slightly, so there was an unfamiliar knot in our bow rope, but she was safe and sound.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had a few days left of our allotted 14, so we stayed and explored locally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n73/IMG_20200307_143001596.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;2&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Liberty Belle moored alongside the allotments.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;A cheeky moorhen on top of a garden wall helping itself from the bird feeder!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On one of our walks we took a picnic with us but, as we drew closer to a country pub, we talked ourselves into a Sunday roast...Mmmmm! By the time we got there we were really ready for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sadly, the pub was closed &quot;Due to staff holiday&quot; and wasn't due to open again until 23rd March. Hmmmm...
We carried on along our path to the next pub. Here they didn't do food. Oh well, they had excellent beer and crisps! As we finished our treat, the sky darkened, so we ate our sandwiches as we walked back to the boat, expecting it to rain any moment. We got back just in time to shelter from the worst of the weather.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we finally left Hertford, turning the boat at the end of the navigation, we went back to Ware. It turned out to be a pretty town with an old priory, (now council owned with public access to the pleasant riverside grounds), and an excellent small museum run by volunteers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The turning point at the end of the navigation in Hertford is just under this very low bridge.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;It used to be a major industry around here.
&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From our mooring in Ware, we decided to walk back to Hertford to the charity cafe that we had failed to visit when we were moored there. Every time we had tried it was either closed or too busy. This time we were in luck and it was just as nice as we had hoped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another walk took us to Hunsdon village. Here we sat on a bench in the memorial garden to drink our flask of cocoa. Behind us a young woman, with her baby strapped to her front and her phone on a tripod, was recording an inspirational message for her followers. Well, I think it was meant to be inspirational but it was in fact annoyingly high pitched, incessantly upbeat, extremely repetitive, very long and with hardly any content. When she finally finished, the contrasting quiet was shocking. We had finished our flask so we got up and left; quite quickly as it happened because she came down the same path immediately after us and we wanted to stay well ahead!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n73/IMG_20200311_103623646.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;12&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The village sign.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;A village hall, a spitfire and a rose.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Yep, that's it really.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n73/IMG_20200311_122925961.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;13&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;A pint of Hertford's McMullen, to recover from that woman!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before leaving Ware, we went for a short walk to look at some interesting buildings we had passed on the way. These turned out to be the remains of an old 19th century water mill, saved from redevelopment, with an explanatory plaque. It needs the plaque because there is very little left to see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The site of the watermill.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we finally set off, we somehow managed to pass right by the boatyard that we had planned to stop at for fuel and moored near the turning for the River Stort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, the following morning, we turned Liberty Belle around, went past the boatyard again, turned at the next turning space and this time, stopped for fuel. Diesel for the engine, gas for the cooker and coal for the fire. Then off up the River Stort. It is narrow, winding and more natural looking than the Lee. Definitely worth the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;We were so busy admiring these trees that we missed the boatyard completely.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;I think the Latin motto translates as&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;&quot;Don't make a special trip.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n73/IMG_20200314_143144022.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;27&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;We admired this new development alongside the river.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;In our opinion, nicely done.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile we had arranged to pick up Cathy at the top of the River Stort in Bishops Stortford. 
Due to the lack of mooring space, which is often a problem on rivers, we ended up travelling further each day than intended, so we made good time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, we did become a little concerned when we heard from a passer-by that there was a narrowboat straddling the river a couple of locks further along, preventing anyone from travelling. Oh great! We weren't sure how we were going to tackle the problem but assumed a plan would emerge when we reached it...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we did arrive at the offending boat, there was a man standing on its roof reaching for the centre rope, which he threw to a couple waiting on the bank. They then managed to pull the boat to the side. We pulled in just beyond it and offered the use of our mallet to re-secure the pins which were still attached to the back rope. It was a simple case of the pins having slipped out of damp ground, not pointless vandalism as one onlooker suggested. The helpful people were kayakers who couldn't get past the narrow boat, so had taken matters into their 
own hands. So that was a lot easier than we were expecting! Well done kayakers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n73/P1290961.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;28&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Kayakers to the rescue!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We headed straight for Bishops Stortford thinking that we would have to turn if there was no mooring space and get as close as we could. However we were delighted that we managed to moor just a short walk from the station. As usual, because we were in a reasonably large town, we made use of the launderette and went to the shops to restock. We were shocked to discover that the locusts had been! It was our first experience of shoppers panic buying and leaving the shelves bare. It took two and a half days for Tony to find us a packet of loo roll! (Luckily we had a stock of The Metro in reserve, that we could use in an emergency...)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On our first morning in Bishops Stortford, having decided that we would wait for our guest, Cathy, before eating our main meal, we decided to fortify ourselves with a Wetherspoons breakfast. Little did we know that this would be our last for some time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n73/IMG_20200316_124906854.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;29&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Moored in Bishop's Stortford.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our guest arrived safe and sound.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following morning, as soon as Tony had found a packet of loo rolls, (phew!), we left Bishops Stortford with Cathy at the helm. The mooring in Sawbridgeworth that we had used on the way up the river was occupied but we found a free space a little further down. After dinner we went for a stroll but didn't go into the local pub because we were all being advised against it. Oh well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n73/P1290967.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;30&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Cathy at the helm.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n73/IMG_20200317_172735724.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;31&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;We took Cathy to see the sights in Sawbridgeworth.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;!?!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Harlow was our next stop. We walked into town through Town Park, a large public space owned by the council which was designed for the New Town of Harlow by Dame Sylvia Crowe in the 1950's. It has an outdoor paddling pool, a petting zoo, a lake, a skate park and cafe. It must have been fabulous in it's day and, although a bit dated, it is still a delightful place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We discovered a lovely looking coffee shop in town which wasn't at all busy so, taking hand washing and distancing seriously, we went in. The owner served us and explained that she had only been open 3 months. We discussed the growing coronavirus situation but she seemed upbeat and wasn't going to let all her hard work be for nothing. Fingers crossed for her (and everyone else).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;We walked through Harlow Town Park...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n73/IMG_20200318_134609922.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;35&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;...a delightful public space.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we were planning our trip on the tidal section of the River Thames, we initially thought we would quite like to go at 5 am, to avoid any other boats. However, the tides wouldn't be right for that time of the day, so we decided we would wait for a sunny day, with no wind, when the tide was not too strong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Cathy on board and due to go home on Monday, we made a snap decision to put aside our careful planning, take advantage of having an extra crew member and include Cathy in our exciting trip. Tony booked us in. We had 3 days to get to Limehouse Lock so we needed to get a move on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With us all taking turns to drive and do the locks we made good time and moored in Broxbourne.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here Cathy had her first 'shopping-in-a-crisis' experience. She went to find the ingredients for a tagine  and came back with the ingredients for a mushroom strogonoff. As you all know, flexibility was becoming key! Needless to say, it was delicious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;I think this heron rather likes the idea of the pub opposite...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n73/P1300032.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;39&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;...both good things in one place.
&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Broxbourne we teamed up with another boat to share the locks. This didn't last long because, unfortunately, he broke down. After towing him to the side, he assured us he would be able to fix it himself, so we were on our own again. As soon as we found what looked like safe moorings within an easy day's travel of Limehouse Dock, we stopped for the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following day, after a detour around Olympic Park, we arrived in Limehouse Dock, ready to go through the lock onto the Thames first thing in the morning, as planned. The sun was due to shine but the wind was forecast to be rather stronger than ideal...  We took a look at the river and it seemed remarkably calm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Bye, bye Merchants Square.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Joe, Kirsty and Carter on board, we left Paddington Basin behind, ready for the next part of our adventure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When our guests had joined us a few days before they had left their van in Hertford at the end of the Lee Navigation, so we spent the next few days travelling there, with the wind and rain trying hard to put us off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As soon as we had set off, Tony realised there was something missing from the top of the boat. Our gang plank!
Initially we thought it had been stolen but we eventually concluded that Storm Dennis was probably the culprit. Very annoying!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Things could be worse...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We turned onto the Regents Canal and were hoping to have a visit from John and Melissa on the way but it rained so heavily that they got soaked and sadly had to abandon the plan.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;This was very tempting but we didn't have time to stop on the way.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Maybe on the way back? &lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn1&quot; id=&quot;ref1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For most of the week, Joe was working from the boat but on the Thursday, he went by train into the office in London. The rest of us moved Liberty Belle from railway station to railway station and let him know where to find us at the end of the day...!
We travelled some of the way with a boat called Lucky No.7, also braving the weather. The boat has a permanent mooring on the river but seems to travel about a lot. The skipper has a friendly dog, who, whenever she got the chance, tried to board our boat.
When we arrived at their home mooring, they turned off and we went through the next lock on our own. As we were waiting in the lock, Lucky No.7's dog suddenly sprang into action, left her boat while the skipper was mooring and hurtled over the bridge, joining a couple taking their dog for a walk. The two dogs were obviously very pleased to see each other. The couple turned back and, returning the dog to her owner, explained to me that the dogs were from the same litter. Apparently, when the sister dog from Lucky No.7 leaves the mooring, the brother dog spends each day staring up the canal in the direction they went. Whenever they return there is a dramatic re-union! How sweet!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Lee Navigation follows the River Lee (or Lea - the jury is still out), and the mooring opportunities are few and far between. Not having a gang plank reduced our options further. As we got closer to Hertford we began to worry that there wouldn't be a space there for us....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Ware riverside gazebos. Where? Ware...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just before Hertford, we met a CRT engineer who was just moving one of their boats through a lock. He then helped us through too and reassured us that there were a couple of spaces in Hertford, one where his boat had been moored the day before and another recently vacated one, so we should be fine. Sure enough, we did find a lovely mooring alongside some allotments, a short distance from the town and the supermarket. It wasn't very close to Joe's van but was very near to a car park, and he was able to move there before unloading all his gear from Liberty Belle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They left us on the Saturday morning to get to Bursledon just in time for puppy training classes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We explored Hertford and decided that we really like the small town and were happy to leave Liberty Belle moored there whilst we went back to the house for a short visit. This trip home was for a sad occasion. Our dear friend, Trixie, who had been our next-door neighbour for 25 years, had sadly passed away. We went to join her family and friends at her funeral service. So sad. She will be missed by so many people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Where Next?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, when Tony and I discussed our adventures we had, to my relief, decided against taking Liberty Belle onto the tidal section of the Thames, from Limehouse to Teddington. On investigation Tony had discovered that we needed a VHF radio and someone who was trained to use it, so I was relaxed in the knowledge that this wasn't going to happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just before we went back to the house, however, Tony found a VHF training course in Southampton going cheap for last minute bookings. He booked and paid for the course which was scheduled for the day after our arrival. Of course he passed with full marks and managed to borrow a hand-held radio from Helen and Peter. (Thanks guys!) So, that is my fate sealed....&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rachel Glombek</name></author><category term="LibertyBelle" /><summary type="html">From Paddington to Hertford 18th - 25th February 2020 Our route</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">“Welcome to Merchants Square”</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/libertybellenewsletter/libertybelle/2020/03/15/welcome-to-merchants-square.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="&quot;Welcome to Merchants Square&quot;" /><published>2020-03-15T19:27:00+00:00</published><updated>2020-03-15T19:27:00+00:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/libertybellenewsletter/libertybelle/2020/03/15/welcome-to-merchants-square</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/libertybellenewsletter/libertybelle/2020/03/15/welcome-to-merchants-square.html">&lt;h2&gt;Paddington Basin&lt;/h2&gt;

 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n71/IMG_20200211_144247794.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Hi Paddington!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, there we were, fighting Storm Dennis as we approached Paddington Basin. We had booked and paid for our mooring in advance because we had arranged to meet Joe, Kirsty and Carter there in a few days time. We were all looking forward to a bit of sight-seeing there before we explored the River Lee. As it was so windy, it was a relief to know that they were expecting us (or, as our confirmation email had stated, &quot;looking forward to seeing you&quot;), because turning around in the basin and searching for a possibly non-existent mooring space was going to be doubly difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we passed the restaurant boat, 'Darcie Green', permanently moored outside Paddington station, the wind, funnelled between the buildings, became very strong and we only just missed knocking the boat as the diners watched...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(The next boat to come along behind us did bump into poor Darcie and just stayed there overnight, moored against the restaurant!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We carried on, arriving just in front of our pontoon in the Merchants Square area of Paddington Basin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was no space!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now what do we do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We pulled over to the edge of the canal and I held onto the centre rope, whilst Tony went to investigate the pontoon situation. Storm Dennis wasn't keen on Liberty Belle staying where she was but I stood my ground!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst Tony was confirming the lack of mooring space, a security guard approached me and insisted that I move our boat. Tony returned and we both tried to explain that we had booked and payed for a mooring on the pontoon and we were not going to travel past the pontoon, turn and return the way we had come, partly because it was far too windy but mostly because we had already paid to be here!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our explanation did little to stem the flow of his insistence that we move.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tony tied Liberty Belle to the light fittings to save my arm muscles, (which probably didn't go down too well), then went on board to contact the Canal &amp;amp; River Trust as it was far too windy outside for a phone conversation. After the usual confusion, they requested that Tony take a note of the number of each of the 6 boats on the pontoon. This he did. It didn't help much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the security guard's immediate boss, Duke, arrived and showed us a CRT mooring amongst some little hire boats which we could use. He and the original guard helped with Liberty Belle's ropes and we tied up to the temporary mooring, after promising the CRT that we would move onto the official pontoon as soon as a space became available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok. Great. Agreed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Well, agreed, except we were not going to stay on the boat all day waiting for this to happen, we had paid to be here and we were going to make the most of it..!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all shook hands, (probably the last hand-shakes of 2020) and, with smiles all around, Duke said &quot;Welcome to Merchants Square&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n71/P1290707.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;2&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Liberty Belle giving the boats moored at the pontoon a very hard, Paddington stare.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Moored in amongst the hire boats.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;It felt a bit like the naughty step.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So off we went for a walk along the Regents Canal. When we returned the pontoon situation was still the same so we settled down for the night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Evening in Paddington Basin.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just before our 7 a.m. alarm, we were woken by a knocking noise on the boat which gradually travelled from the front of the boat to the back... What could it be?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the knocking got closer to the back we realised it was accompanied by a voice, asking to speak to the occupant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tony stuck his head out of the hatch above our back door and spoke to the two security guards who insisted that we move the boat. Tony insisted he would not and tried to explain the situation, when he could get a word in...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually Duke arrived and sorted things out. Good grief.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We checked the pontoon situation, which hadn't changed, so off we went for a day in London.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On our return things were still the same so we settled down for the night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Tony trying to get on his high horse in Belgravia.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following morning we got up at our own speed, to find that one of the boats on the pontoon was setting off. Great. We moved Liberty Belle into the space, as promised. Phew.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once we were moored, one of the other boats left too, which was very lucky, because the first boat returned from collecting water to find us in his space....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We kept a low profile and went into London again for more sight-seeing. As it was raining, we decided to spend the day in the Victoria and Albert Museum, one of our favourites, and broke the journey back with a visit to The Victoria, a very smart pub near Paddington.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n71/IMG_20200213_103606021_HDR.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;14&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;This allotment was a surprise!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The rather lovely Victoria pub, a very pleasant place to wait for the rain to stop...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After yet another day in the same place, we were running very low on water, so Tony took our large plastic water containers on several trips to a not-so-nearby tap and topped up Liberty Belle's tank using those. Where was I when all this heavy work was taking place? In the launderette. That's important work too, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So by the time Joe, Kirsty and Carter arrived we were moored where we were supposed to be, all clean and topped up with water. They had driven to Hertford, parked the van and taken the train to Paddington, via Liverpool Street station and the underground. Quite an adventure for a puppy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n71/IMG_20200213_182124414.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;17&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Our mooring at the pontoon, the official mooring that we had actually booked...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Kirsty and Carter keeping each other entertained on the train.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a couple of days together in London (during which Kirsty introduced me to the shopping heaven that is Whole Food Market. Oh my goodness, I haven't lived!), we set off to spend half term travelling along the Lee Navigation (in the rain) to find Joe's van.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Where Next?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are now in Bishops Stortford waiting for Cathy to join us by train tomorrow. Our future plans are still the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good luck to all those who are self-isolating and those abroad who have no choice, as well as those who are waiting to see whether they are wanted at work or not. In fact, good luck to us all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep each other safe and well. xx&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rachel Glombek</name></author><category term="LibertyBelle" /><summary type="html">Paddington Basin 11th - 17th February 2020</summary></entry></feed>
