&lt;h2&gt;4th - 21st June 2020&lt;/h2&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;A converted mill near Weybridge. Beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The end of the last newsletter left us at Hampton Court, where we remained, (with a couple of trips to the lock for water), until a nice man knocked on the boat and declared that the mooring charges would resume the following day. We reassured him that we had been expecting it to happen...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n77/20200609-P1310019.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;2&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;We visited the man-made Sand Martins' nest, but no-one was at home...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The gates used to shut off the road and allow horses to race across during Hurst Park Racecourse meetings. The tarmac would be covered in peat and grass cuttings to simulate the 'feel' of the rest of the course.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sunken boat beyond Sunbury Lock had been lifted and our way was now clear but we hadn't yet had our long awaited fish and chips from 'The Red Herring' in Sunbury.... As far as we remembered the chip shop didn't open until Wednesday, so we had a couple of days to kill. We decided to travel further back down river to Kingston and top up our supplies from the conveniently positioned Waitrose there. That done, we spent our allocated single night there and then moved to the opposite side of the river for another night, then off back to Sunbury, where our old mooring was waiting and our fish &amp;amp; chip supper didn't disappoint!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n77/IMG_20200606_113242850.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;4&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The Sunken Boat, lifted by stuffing with air bags...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n77/IMG_20200606_115526136.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;5&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;...then towed to a local boatyard.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once we had passed through Sunbury lock (and over the sunken boat site) our first task was to get some fuel from Shepperton Marina. Phew, that was a relief.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our next move wasn't quite as obvious. After the sunken boat site was the junction with the River Wey which has the Basingstoke Canal branching off it. We had always hoped to spend a reasonable amount of time exploring this area and, as it is the nearest part of the network to our home ground, we assumed we would catch up with visitors and travel to the house for a while. Work was being carried out on the section of the Wey between Guildford and Godalming and was due to re-open 'mid-June', so there was a chance that we would time that right. However, the Basingstoke Canal was closed. Tony had contacted the appropriate people and pleaded his case. As the government guidance didn't allow for overnight stays anywhere and they had no continuous cruisers on the Basingstoke Canal, there was no reason for it to be opened. Apparently they were not going to do a risk assessment of the entire canal just for us....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The alternative was to pass by the Wey and continue up to Lechlade, leaving the Wey and Basingstoke Canal for another time. We had a feeling that if we took this option, it might never be convenient to return.
We had been told by several people how beautiful the river was, so it would be a shame to by-pass it altogether.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, having decided to travel on the river, we had to purchase the appropriate temporary license from the National Trust, the owners of the navigation. Three days would be sufficient for quick visit to Guildford and back, but a week would enable us to have a socially-distanced visit or two, and there was a chance that the section to Godalming would open in the meantime. If the Basingstoke Canal suddenly opened, we would purchase the separate pass for there, and then pay an extra day for the journey from the canal, along the river, back to the Thames.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good, we finally had a plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n77/20200612-P1310063.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;6&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Welcome to the River Wey Navigation.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n77/20200613-P1310147.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;7&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Our River Wey weekly pass.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our week passed by quickly. The river was indeed beautiful, meandering its way through fields lined with trees. The locks were well maintained, (as one would expect from the National Trust), and generally easy to operate. We did however, have to borrow a windlass from the lock keeper because the locking mechanism is very slightly different... It's never straight forward.
The towpaths were quiet; the local wildlife were busy feeding their young; swallows and terns were scooting about around us; Red Kites soaring above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had the scent of meadowsweet on the breeze and glimpses of purple vetch along the banks. Yellow waterlilies were everywhere but as I tried to photograph them they dived underwater,  as if camera-shy. As Liberty Belle pushed through the water, it rushed past her sides and temporarily engulfed the flowers. The presence of so much vegetation in the water was an indication of how shallow it was, and we did indeed come aground on one of the many sharp bends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Excitingly, we did have some visitors whilst we were there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joe and Kirsty caught up with us when we were moored outside a pub that was selling takeaway food and beer. My goodness, that was good from every aspect!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Carol found us in Guildford, a place she knows well, and Tony was subjected to us having a long-awaited catch-up! (He assures us that he enjoyed it too.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was no sign of us being able to take Liberty Belle along the stretch to Godalming, so we decided to complete it on foot and Robin caught up with us there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our week was nearly up; we had just 2 days to head back. As we rejoined the Thames, the section of river from Guildford to Godalming was declared open! Oh, fiddlesticks. Rumour has it though, that the repair to the navigation might not hold, so we could have been caught in Godalming and stranded there indefinitely. Perhaps it was for the best that we had missed it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tony has promised that we can travel the Basingstoke Canal by kayak sometime. I am still deciding whether that's a good idea or not...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Personally I prefer the long walk around...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the junction we passed back onto the Thames, travelling through places that we know, at a faster pace this time because nothing is open. As I write this we are back in Henley. We arrived  after a long day's travel. Tony did battle with the mooring pay machine and lost (or rather, won, as it didn't manage to take his money), but then the warden came around the following morning. It seems that the machine rarely works, so they leave people to fight with it until they give up in anger and frustration, then pay a chap to go from boat to boat taking money and writing mooring tickets out by hand. Modern technology at its finest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Where Next?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have arrived in Oxford now and are going to find a suitable mooring before heading back to the house for a few days to get some jobs done. We won't be doing much socialising, even at a distance, because we want to visit Mary.
When we get back to Liberty Belle, we plan to follow the whole length of the Oxford Canal, then venture onto the Ashby Canal, (Keith's favourite!)&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rachel Glombek</name></author><category term="LibertyBelle" /><summary type="html">From Hampton Court to Henley, via the River Wey 4th - 21st June 2020</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">One banana at a time…</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/libertybellenewsletter/libertybelle/2020/06/04/one-banana-at-a-time.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="One banana at a time..." /><published>2020-06-04T16:47:00+01:00</published><updated>2020-06-04T16:47:00+01:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/libertybellenewsletter/libertybelle/2020/06/04/one-banana-at-a-time</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/libertybellenewsletter/libertybelle/2020/06/04/one-banana-at-a-time.html">&lt;h2&gt;Sunbury to Hampton&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello again. We hope you are all well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like everyone else we have been in lockdown, allowed to undertake only essential journeys, which for us means trips to the nearest water tap and toilet emptying facility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have explored the local area on foot, queued outside the local supermarkets, drunk a lot of tea, (interspersed with coffee to make a change), and eaten rather more than we should.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time has behaved very strangely for us both, not helped by the weather being the same, day after day. On our journey we have always had a little trouble knowing what day it is, but this lockdown has caused us to question the month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of our more reliable ways of marking the passage of time is by banana. Every morning we have a bowl of muesli topped with half a banana each. Every time we go shopping we buy more bananas, and so it goes on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Well, they might be useful, if we want to steam up our glasses and be very short of breath.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Soon it became time for me to wear the tea cosy and...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usually, as we travel along, we find convenient places to buy gas for the cooker or to do our laundry. We did need such services but we were stuck. Thankfully we found a launderette and a Calor Gas seller that would collect and deliver, despite us having no address. Sorted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n76/IMG-20200430-WA0000.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;23&quot; /&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Fab!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the surrounding wildlife have just been getting on with things -&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;crowding for bread, (some people turn up in the park with several whole packets of sliced bread to throw into the water!);&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;shitting, (pardon my language), on everything;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;fighting amongst themselves;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;producing young.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n76/IMG_20200413_153547_471.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;25&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;This pair didn't breed this spring.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;They were probably too busy constantly eating the offerings of bread.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n76/P1300729.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;26&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Our busy little squirrel emptied the contents of the bin most days.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have a particularly aggressive swan at the moorings in Lower Sunbury, our bully-in-residence. He has a mate sitting on a nest at the opposite end of the moorings to us and he patrols the area near our boat, quite some distance from the nest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He is particularly keen on threatening a family of Greylag Geese. He separates them and then chases the male. Cunningly the male leads the swan away from his family towards the end of a pontoon and amongst the boats where the space between them decreases and the swan is eventually unable to follow. Meanwhile the female reassembles her young and leads them in the opposite direction, under the pontoon and meets up with the male there. The swan appears to think his job is temporarily done and leaves them alone for a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On another occasion our bully attacked a visiting female swan. He smacked her head against our boat and then drove her into the mud under a bush behind us. He sat on her, pushing her deep into the mud. We were convinced he had killed her but she eventually showed signs of life, and slowly began to lever herself out of the mud using her beak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back at the nest, there were plenty of visiting geese that didn't get any attention from him because he was too far away to notice!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People came to the park every day to look over the fence at the swan's nest below. For weeks she sat there on her 7 eggs. At last, one morning, 2 chicks were visible in the nest. The following day we went to look over at them on our way out of the park for our walk. What a shock. The two swans were sitting around the nest, with one unhatched egg, one dead chick and no sign of any of the others. So sad. We wondered whether the male swan's aggression extended towards his own chicks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the moments between cups of tea, we have done a few jobs to smarten Liberty Belle up a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In particular, Tony has touched up her paintwork where it was most needed. We already had some paint on board that the previous owners had left behind, but not enough to get the whole job done. Karen, Jon and the boys, who live in this area, very kindly received paint parcels for us and delivered them to the mooring, (in a socially distancing way, of course).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many, many thanks to them.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Won't she look smart when we are released?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Officially the canal system has been open for journeys since 1st of June. However, things are not quite that simple...there is a another obstacle between us and freedom. Just beyond Sunbury Lock, a widebeam boat, (like Liberty Belle but twice the width), has sunk and is blocking passage along the river.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Picking through all the rumours and reports we have heard and seen about the incident, some of which are contradictory, we have surmised that the boat &lt;em&gt;somehow&lt;/em&gt; became sucked against the barrier across the top of the weir and remained there for &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; number of weeks. Then &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; caused the boat to move and it broke through the barrier and began to sink. The Environment Agency got involved then because it was damaging the weir. They managed to pull it off and back onto the river but it continued to sink. They were unable to lift it because the water levels were too high at the time for it to be done safely, so they attached a buoy to mark its position and declared that section of the river to be temporarily closed. That was on the 6th March. Until recently, the lockdown has prevented a team from working on it. However, a survey has now been completed with a view to removing it soon.... We await further news.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n76/IMG_20200519_142828971.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;40&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Underneath those buoys is a widebeam boat.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime we decided to have a change of scenery and move back down river to Hampton Court, where the mooring charges are being waived for the time being.

&lt;p&gt;So, here we are, outside Hampton Court Palace, opposite the popular Thames Ditton Beach, people watching. On this busy stretch of river, every kind of water craft passes by, from very humble inflatables to showy gin palaces, some of which dwarf poor Liberty Belle!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will move back to Lower Sunbury in a couple of days, (because there are rumours that the long awaited opening of the fish and chip shop has actually happened), then escape as soon as we get the go-ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Where Next?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All being well, we hope to travel along the River Wey and Basingstoke Canal next, before visiting Lechlade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep safe, everyone. xx&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Our mooring in Sunbury.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There we were in Kingston Upon Thames as the restrictions for limiting the virus were coming into effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cathy managed to book herself a train journey from Kingston on Thames for the morning after we arrived there. Luckily she made it home before the lockdown came into effect and avoided being stranded with us. A holiday is one thing, but that might have been a step too far for her!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After waving Cathy off, we joined the socially distanced queue outside Waitrose and stocked up on groceries. Then we went for a walk, following the Thames to Richmond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Walking down Richmond Hill.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We stayed a second night in Kingston and then moved on to Sunbury. On the way a moored boater shouted a warning that the lock we were approaching was closed due to a sunken boat blocking passage. Oh heck! He managed to pass on directions to some pleasant 24 hour moorings at the edge of a tiny public park. That was good of him because the mooring on the lock approach was full.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it happened, the following morning we received instructions from the Canal &amp;amp; River Trust and the Environment Agency to stop moving, along with the news that all mooring restrictions were now lifted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the terms of our 'continuous cruiser' licence we are normally obliged to move regularly, observing the mooring restrictions of up to 14 days in one place and travelling at least 25 miles in a year. This obviously suited us under normal circumstances. Now that the circumstances were far from normal, we were obliged to remain where we were.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We could have chosen at this stage to go back to our house but we have someone living there at the moment so we were concerned about the domino effect that our return would cause. Plus, Liberty Belle is on a mooring where the water levels alter daily and we would have had no way of checking on her for an unknown amount of time. So, with all things considered, we decided to stay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank goodness we didn't wait for a less windy day to travel the tidal section of the Thames, otherwise we would have been in the London Docklands area when we were asked to stop travelling, which may not have been quite as pleasant.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Our nearest bridge over the Thames is Walton Bridge.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;This is the 6th Walton Bridge. Whatever do they do with them?&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course we are allowed to move Liberty Belle to fetch water and to empty the loo...! This involves a 6 mile round trip back to Molesey Lock, where the nearest facilities are. We cannot turn around this side of the lock because there is a danger of getting sucked against the weir, so we have to actually pass through the lock, turn on the other side and go straight back into the lock to operate it again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under normal circumstances, this large lock is electrically operated but now we have to use a wheel and levers which operate it hydraulically. This is to deter people from using it and to lessen the need for a lock keeper to be present.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The once-a-week water ritual seems to take for ever and is no small effort, but we are in no rush...&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;These Egyptian Geese have produced a family, unlike the pair at our mooring.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Two of the many tufted ducks in the area, but none of them come to visit us...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from the concerns that we all have at this time, we also wonder what we will do if we run out of cooking gas or diesel... Having investigated, Tony has located a chap that will deliver gas, so we hope he is still operating when we need him. We think we have enough coal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are safe, comfortable and feeling lucky. We are moored against a narrow public park where people come to feed the ducks, geese and swans. Liberty Belle is positioned at the end of the park where there is no reason for people to walk past us, so we have quite a private section of path at the back of the boat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within walking distance we have a choice of supermarkets, some bins and a few small green spaces. We have a routine of sorts, which mainly revolves around meal times and our 3 o'clock bun!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our boaty neighbour is a friendly chap trying to cope with two dogs that are used to rather more freedom. He takes them to a nearby park where they can take a dip in the river. He is only a short distance from his private moorings which are unfortunately the other side of the sunken boat...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from our human visitors to the park we have a pair each of swans, Egyptian Geese and Mandarin ducks, several parakeets, Canada Geese, Mallards and black headed gulls, and a squirrel to watch, with regular appearances by a Great Crested Grebe, a cormorant, a swimmer, stand-up paddle boarders, kayakers, rowing boats and a chap on a hydroplane board. (A passer-by and I decided the hydroplaner must be James Bond, currently furloughed.) Tony has also seen a kingfisher on several occasions which only goes to prove that he has the best seat in the boat.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Presumably it is quieter there than usual. He's not been seen since, but it doesn't mean he's not there...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know some of you will be busier than you have ever been but if others of you have run out of things to do, you can always read the newsletter archive - just click on the blue button on the top of this email. The archive follows the format of a blog which means the most recent entry is at the top, so, to read them in the correct order, you can click on the word 'Posts' on the top right, then choose the top title, which is the first entry from August 2018. That lot should keep you busy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will send another newsletter when I have anything to report...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No fever to report yet, except maybe a touch of cabin fever...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(If we do catch the virus, I will blame the Tesco shoppers.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have now run out of excuses and have started to address Liberty Belle's rust patches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look after yourselves. Tony and I welcome emails, it would be lovely to hear from you.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Lets just check how it is before we commit ourselves!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;conversationtalk&quot;&gt;&quot;London VTS, this is Narrow Boat Liberty Belle. Over&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;conversationlisten&quot;&gt;&quot;crackle....crackle....narrow bo....hiss...crackle....hiss...&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;conversationtalk&quot;&gt;&quot;London VTS, this is Narrow Boat Liberty Belle. Repeat please. Over&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;conversationlisten&quot;&gt;&quot;crackle....crackle....Liberty Belle...hiss...crackle....hiss...&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;conversationtalk&quot;&gt;&quot;London VTS, this is Liberty Belle. We are a fifty-eight foot narrow boat with three people on board about to enter the River Thames from Limehouse Lock. Out&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n74/P1300169.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;2&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The Limehouse Lock Keeper opens the gates...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With my heart in my mouth, my toes curled and my body tense, (as if on board an out-of-control roller coaster), I stood on the back of Liberty Belle, with Tony and Cathy, as we went through Limehouse Lock and onto the massive River Thames.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tony had the radio clipped to himself, and the instructions for passing under each of the first 29 bridges were printed off, put into plastic wallets and held fast in front of us with a strong magnet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our main concern was an engine breakdown, when we would need to deploy our possibly inadequate anchor. Our boat purchase survey simply noted &quot;There is a small anchor&quot;, which doesn't fill you with confidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was scary but wonderful!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;6th - 21st March 2020&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Our route&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;

 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n73/P1290876cropped.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;At last, I managed to take a photo of a kingfisher!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the train window, on our journey back to Hertford, we could see that the Weeping Willows were declaring the start of spring with their stunningly bright green leaves. Maybe the winter was gradually petering out. Realistically we know that March weather can be tricky, giving you spring one minute and winter the next, so we weren't completely fooled, but it was cheering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We found Liberty Belle as we had left her. Well, almost. A neighbouring boater had moved us slightly, so there was an unfamiliar knot in our bow rope, but she was safe and sound.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had a few days left of our allotted 14, so we stayed and explored locally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n73/IMG_20200307_143001596.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;2&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Liberty Belle moored alongside the allotments.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;A cheeky moorhen on top of a garden wall helping itself from the bird feeder!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On one of our walks we took a picnic with us but, as we drew closer to a country pub, we talked ourselves into a Sunday roast...Mmmmm! By the time we got there we were really ready for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sadly, the pub was closed &quot;Due to staff holiday&quot; and wasn't due to open again until 23rd March. Hmmmm...
We carried on along our path to the next pub. Here they didn't do food. Oh well, they had excellent beer and crisps! As we finished our treat, the sky darkened, so we ate our sandwiches as we walked back to the boat, expecting it to rain any moment. We got back just in time to shelter from the worst of the weather.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we finally left Hertford, turning the boat at the end of the navigation, we went back to Ware. It turned out to be a pretty town with an old priory, (now council owned with public access to the pleasant riverside grounds), and an excellent small museum run by volunteers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n73/P1290826.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;4&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Liberty Belle moored in Ware.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n73/P1290955.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;11&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;It used to be a major industry around here.
&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From our mooring in Ware, we decided to walk back to Hertford to the charity cafe that we had failed to visit when we were moored there. Every time we had tried it was either closed or too busy. This time we were in luck and it was just as nice as we had hoped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another walk took us to Hunsdon village. Here we sat on a bench in the memorial garden to drink our flask of cocoa. Behind us a young woman, with her baby strapped to her front and her phone on a tripod, was recording an inspirational message for her followers. Well, I think it was meant to be inspirational but it was in fact annoyingly high pitched, incessantly upbeat, extremely repetitive, very long and with hardly any content. When she finally finished, the contrasting quiet was shocking. We had finished our flask so we got up and left; quite quickly as it happened because she came down the same path immediately after us and we wanted to stay well ahead!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n73/IMG_20200311_103623646.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;12&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The village sign.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;A village hall, a spitfire and a rose.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Yep, that's it really.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n73/IMG_20200311_122925961.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;13&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;A pint of Hertford's McMullen, to recover from that woman!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before leaving Ware, we went for a short walk to look at some interesting buildings we had passed on the way. These turned out to be the remains of an old 19th century water mill, saved from redevelopment, with an explanatory plaque. It needs the plaque because there is very little left to see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n73/IMG_20200312_114720956.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;14&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Taking on water.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n73/IMG_20200312_092735184.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;15&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The site of the watermill.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we finally set off, we somehow managed to pass right by the boatyard that we had planned to stop at for fuel and moored near the turning for the River Stort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, the following morning, we turned Liberty Belle around, went past the boatyard again, turned at the next turning space and this time, stopped for fuel. Diesel for the engine, gas for the cooker and coal for the fire. Then off up the River Stort. It is narrow, winding and more natural looking than the Lee. Definitely worth the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n73/P1290858.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;16&quot; /&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;We were so busy admiring these trees that we missed the boatyard completely.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n73/P1290928.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;18&quot; /&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;I think the Latin motto translates as&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n73/IMG_20200314_143144022.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;27&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;We admired this new development alongside the river.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;In our opinion, nicely done.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile we had arranged to pick up Cathy at the top of the River Stort in Bishops Stortford. 
Due to the lack of mooring space, which is often a problem on rivers, we ended up travelling further each day than intended, so we made good time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, we did become a little concerned when we heard from a passer-by that there was a narrowboat straddling the river a couple of locks further along, preventing anyone from travelling. Oh great! We weren't sure how we were going to tackle the problem but assumed a plan would emerge when we reached it...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we did arrive at the offending boat, there was a man standing on its roof reaching for the centre rope, which he threw to a couple waiting on the bank. They then managed to pull the boat to the side. We pulled in just beyond it and offered the use of our mallet to re-secure the pins which were still attached to the back rope. It was a simple case of the pins having slipped out of damp ground, not pointless vandalism as one onlooker suggested. The helpful people were kayakers who couldn't get past the narrow boat, so had taken matters into their 
own hands. So that was a lot easier than we were expecting! Well done kayakers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n73/P1290961.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;28&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Kayakers to the rescue!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We headed straight for Bishops Stortford thinking that we would have to turn if there was no mooring space and get as close as we could. However we were delighted that we managed to moor just a short walk from the station. As usual, because we were in a reasonably large town, we made use of the launderette and went to the shops to restock. We were shocked to discover that the locusts had been! It was our first experience of shoppers panic buying and leaving the shelves bare. It took two and a half days for Tony to find us a packet of loo roll! (Luckily we had a stock of The Metro in reserve, that we could use in an emergency...)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On our first morning in Bishops Stortford, having decided that we would wait for our guest, Cathy, before eating our main meal, we decided to fortify ourselves with a Wetherspoons breakfast. Little did we know that this would be our last for some time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n73/IMG_20200316_124906854.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;29&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Moored in Bishop's Stortford.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our guest arrived safe and sound.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following morning, as soon as Tony had found a packet of loo rolls, (phew!), we left Bishops Stortford with Cathy at the helm. The mooring in Sawbridgeworth that we had used on the way up the river was occupied but we found a free space a little further down. After dinner we went for a stroll but didn't go into the local pub because we were all being advised against it. Oh well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n73/P1290967.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;30&quot; /&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;We took Cathy to see the sights in Sawbridgeworth.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;!?!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Harlow was our next stop. We walked into town through Town Park, a large public space owned by the council which was designed for the New Town of Harlow by Dame Sylvia Crowe in the 1950's. It has an outdoor paddling pool, a petting zoo, a lake, a skate park and cafe. It must have been fabulous in it's day and, although a bit dated, it is still a delightful place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We discovered a lovely looking coffee shop in town which wasn't at all busy so, taking hand washing and distancing seriously, we went in. The owner served us and explained that she had only been open 3 months. We discussed the growing coronavirus situation but she seemed upbeat and wasn't going to let all her hard work be for nothing. Fingers crossed for her (and everyone else).&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;...a delightful public space.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we were planning our trip on the tidal section of the River Thames, we initially thought we would quite like to go at 5 am, to avoid any other boats. However, the tides wouldn't be right for that time of the day, so we decided we would wait for a sunny day, with no wind, when the tide was not too strong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Cathy on board and due to go home on Monday, we made a snap decision to put aside our careful planning, take advantage of having an extra crew member and include Cathy in our exciting trip. Tony booked us in. We had 3 days to get to Limehouse Lock so we needed to get a move on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With us all taking turns to drive and do the locks we made good time and moored in Broxbourne.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here Cathy had her first 'shopping-in-a-crisis' experience. She went to find the ingredients for a tagine  and came back with the ingredients for a mushroom strogonoff. As you all know, flexibility was becoming key! Needless to say, it was delicious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;I think this heron rather likes the idea of the pub opposite...&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n73/P1300032.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;39&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;...both good things in one place.
&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Broxbourne we teamed up with another boat to share the locks. This didn't last long because, unfortunately, he broke down. After towing him to the side, he assured us he would be able to fix it himself, so we were on our own again. As soon as we found what looked like safe moorings within an easy day's travel of Limehouse Dock, we stopped for the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following day, after a detour around Olympic Park, we arrived in Limehouse Dock, ready to go through the lock onto the Thames first thing in the morning, as planned. The sun was due to shine but the wind was forecast to be rather stronger than ideal...  We took a look at the river and it seemed remarkably calm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;18th - 25th February 2020&lt;/h2&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Bye, bye Merchants Square.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Joe, Kirsty and Carter on board, we left Paddington Basin behind, ready for the next part of our adventure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When our guests had joined us a few days before they had left their van in Hertford at the end of the Lee Navigation, so we spent the next few days travelling there, with the wind and rain trying hard to put us off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As soon as we had set off, Tony realised there was something missing from the top of the boat. Our gang plank!
Initially we thought it had been stolen but we eventually concluded that Storm Dennis was probably the culprit. Very annoying!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Things could be worse...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We turned onto the Regents Canal and were hoping to have a visit from John and Melissa on the way but it rained so heavily that they got soaked and sadly had to abandon the plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n72/IMG-20200219-WA0000.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;14&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;This was very tempting but we didn't have time to stop on the way.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Maybe on the way back? &lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn1&quot; id=&quot;ref1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For most of the week, Joe was working from the boat but on the Thursday, he went by train into the office in London. The rest of us moved Liberty Belle from railway station to railway station and let him know where to find us at the end of the day...!
We travelled some of the way with a boat called Lucky No.7, also braving the weather. The boat has a permanent mooring on the river but seems to travel about a lot. The skipper has a friendly dog, who, whenever she got the chance, tried to board our boat.
When we arrived at their home mooring, they turned off and we went through the next lock on our own. As we were waiting in the lock, Lucky No.7's dog suddenly sprang into action, left her boat while the skipper was mooring and hurtled over the bridge, joining a couple taking their dog for a walk. The two dogs were obviously very pleased to see each other. The couple turned back and, returning the dog to her owner, explained to me that the dogs were from the same litter. Apparently, when the sister dog from Lucky No.7 leaves the mooring, the brother dog spends each day staring up the canal in the direction they went. Whenever they return there is a dramatic re-union! How sweet!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Lee Navigation follows the River Lee (or Lea - the jury is still out), and the mooring opportunities are few and far between. Not having a gang plank reduced our options further. As we got closer to Hertford we began to worry that there wouldn't be a space there for us....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n72/P1290803.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;15&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Liberty Belle's extra crew members walking the towpath which was suddenly diverted. We didn't see them again until the next lock...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Ware riverside gazebos. Where? Ware...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just before Hertford, we met a CRT engineer who was just moving one of their boats through a lock. He then helped us through too and reassured us that there were a couple of spaces in Hertford, one where his boat had been moored the day before and another recently vacated one, so we should be fine. Sure enough, we did find a lovely mooring alongside some allotments, a short distance from the town and the supermarket. It wasn't very close to Joe's van but was very near to a car park, and he was able to move there before unloading all his gear from Liberty Belle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They left us on the Saturday morning to get to Bursledon just in time for puppy training classes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We explored Hertford and decided that we really like the small town and were happy to leave Liberty Belle moored there whilst we went back to the house for a short visit. This trip home was for a sad occasion. Our dear friend, Trixie, who had been our next-door neighbour for 25 years, had sadly passed away. We went to join her family and friends at her funeral service. So sad. She will be missed by so many people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Where Next?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, when Tony and I discussed our adventures we had, to my relief, decided against taking Liberty Belle onto the tidal section of the Thames, from Limehouse to Teddington. On investigation Tony had discovered that we needed a VHF radio and someone who was trained to use it, so I was relaxed in the knowledge that this wasn't going to happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just before we went back to the house, however, Tony found a VHF training course in Southampton going cheap for last minute bookings. He booked and paid for the course which was scheduled for the day after our arrival. Of course he passed with full marks and managed to borrow a hand-held radio from Helen and Peter. (Thanks guys!) So, that is my fate sealed....&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rachel Glombek</name></author><category term="LibertyBelle" /><summary type="html">From Paddington to Hertford 18th - 25th February 2020 Our route</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">“Welcome to Merchants Square”</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/libertybellenewsletter/libertybelle/2020/03/15/welcome-to-merchants-square.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="&quot;Welcome to Merchants Square&quot;" /><published>2020-03-15T19:27:00+00:00</published><updated>2020-03-15T19:27:00+00:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/libertybellenewsletter/libertybelle/2020/03/15/welcome-to-merchants-square</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/libertybellenewsletter/libertybelle/2020/03/15/welcome-to-merchants-square.html">&lt;h2&gt;Paddington Basin&lt;/h2&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Our route&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n71/IMG_20200211_144247794.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Hi Paddington!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, there we were, fighting Storm Dennis as we approached Paddington Basin. We had booked and paid for our mooring in advance because we had arranged to meet Joe, Kirsty and Carter there in a few days time. We were all looking forward to a bit of sight-seeing there before we explored the River Lee. As it was so windy, it was a relief to know that they were expecting us (or, as our confirmation email had stated, &quot;looking forward to seeing you&quot;), because turning around in the basin and searching for a possibly non-existent mooring space was going to be doubly difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we passed the restaurant boat, 'Darcie Green', permanently moored outside Paddington station, the wind, funnelled between the buildings, became very strong and we only just missed knocking the boat as the diners watched...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(The next boat to come along behind us did bump into poor Darcie and just stayed there overnight, moored against the restaurant!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We carried on, arriving just in front of our pontoon in the Merchants Square area of Paddington Basin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was no space!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now what do we do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We pulled over to the edge of the canal and I held onto the centre rope, whilst Tony went to investigate the pontoon situation. Storm Dennis wasn't keen on Liberty Belle staying where she was but I stood my ground!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst Tony was confirming the lack of mooring space, a security guard approached me and insisted that I move our boat. Tony returned and we both tried to explain that we had booked and payed for a mooring on the pontoon and we were not going to travel past the pontoon, turn and return the way we had come, partly because it was far too windy but mostly because we had already paid to be here!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our explanation did little to stem the flow of his insistence that we move.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tony tied Liberty Belle to the light fittings to save my arm muscles, (which probably didn't go down too well), then went on board to contact the Canal &amp;amp; River Trust as it was far too windy outside for a phone conversation. After the usual confusion, they requested that Tony take a note of the number of each of the 6 boats on the pontoon. This he did. It didn't help much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the security guard's immediate boss, Duke, arrived and showed us a CRT mooring amongst some little hire boats which we could use. He and the original guard helped with Liberty Belle's ropes and we tied up to the temporary mooring, after promising the CRT that we would move onto the official pontoon as soon as a space became available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok. Great. Agreed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Well, agreed, except we were not going to stay on the boat all day waiting for this to happen, we had paid to be here and we were going to make the most of it..!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all shook hands, (probably the last hand-shakes of 2020) and, with smiles all around, Duke said &quot;Welcome to Merchants Square&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n71/P1290707.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;2&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Liberty Belle giving the boats moored at the pontoon a very hard, Paddington stare.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n71/IMG_20200211_143003268_HDR.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;3&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Moored in amongst the hire boats.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;It felt a bit like the naughty step.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So off we went for a walk along the Regents Canal. When we returned the pontoon situation was still the same so we settled down for the night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n71/IMG_20200211_145611927.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;4&quot; /&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Evening in Paddington Basin.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just before our 7 a.m. alarm, we were woken by a knocking noise on the boat which gradually travelled from the front of the boat to the back... What could it be?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the knocking got closer to the back we realised it was accompanied by a voice, asking to speak to the occupant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tony stuck his head out of the hatch above our back door and spoke to the two security guards who insisted that we move the boat. Tony insisted he would not and tried to explain the situation, when he could get a word in...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually Duke arrived and sorted things out. Good grief.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We checked the pontoon situation, which hadn't changed, so off we went for a day in London.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On our return things were still the same so we settled down for the night.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Tony trying to get on his high horse in Belgravia.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following morning we got up at our own speed, to find that one of the boats on the pontoon was setting off. Great. We moved Liberty Belle into the space, as promised. Phew.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once we were moored, one of the other boats left too, which was very lucky, because the first boat returned from collecting water to find us in his space....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We kept a low profile and went into London again for more sight-seeing. As it was raining, we decided to spend the day in the Victoria and Albert Museum, one of our favourites, and broke the journey back with a visit to The Victoria, a very smart pub near Paddington.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n71/IMG_20200213_103606021_HDR.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;14&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;This allotment was a surprise!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The rather lovely Victoria pub, a very pleasant place to wait for the rain to stop...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After yet another day in the same place, we were running very low on water, so Tony took our large plastic water containers on several trips to a not-so-nearby tap and topped up Liberty Belle's tank using those. Where was I when all this heavy work was taking place? In the launderette. That's important work too, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So by the time Joe, Kirsty and Carter arrived we were moored where we were supposed to be, all clean and topped up with water. They had driven to Hertford, parked the van and taken the train to Paddington, via Liverpool Street station and the underground. Quite an adventure for a puppy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n71/IMG_20200213_182124414.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;17&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Our mooring at the pontoon, the official mooring that we had actually booked...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Kirsty and Carter keeping each other entertained on the train.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a couple of days together in London (during which Kirsty introduced me to the shopping heaven that is Whole Food Market. Oh my goodness, I haven't lived!), we set off to spend half term travelling along the Lee Navigation (in the rain) to find Joe's van.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Where Next?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are now in Bishops Stortford waiting for Cathy to join us by train tomorrow. Our future plans are still the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good luck to all those who are self-isolating and those abroad who have no choice, as well as those who are waiting to see whether they are wanted at work or not. In fact, good luck to us all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep each other safe and well. xx&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rachel Glombek</name></author><category term="LibertyBelle" /><summary type="html">Paddington Basin 11th - 17th February 2020</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Slow Boat to London</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/libertybellenewsletter/libertybelle/2020/03/13/slow-boat-to-london.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Slow Boat to London" /><published>2020-03-13T17:47:00+00:00</published><updated>2020-03-13T17:47:00+00:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/libertybellenewsletter/libertybelle/2020/03/13/slow-boat-to-london</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/libertybellenewsletter/libertybelle/2020/03/13/slow-boat-to-london.html">&lt;h2&gt;From Uxbridge to Greenford&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;29th January - 11th February 2020&lt;/h2&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Our route&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Cowley Lock&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were on our way to London along the Grand Onion. Last time we were here we had scooted past the Slough Arm, so this time we turned at the well hidden junction to explore this short, surprisingly rural, branch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n70/P1290515.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;2&quot; /&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n70/P1290535.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;4&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;We squeezed through the gap past the boatyard with a boat swinging in the air.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n70/P1290538.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;5&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;This pretty, rural setting is very popular mooring, with the boats doubled up along most of the branch.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;A muntjac deer watching us turn out of the Slough Arm back onto the Grand Onion.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back on the Grand Onion we passed through the Hanwell Locks outside the old Asylum and looked for a mooring in Brentford.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n70/P1290558.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;7&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Oops. A bit top-heavy?&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;A slope for an embarrassed horse to escape the canal.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last time we were in Brentford, we found a mooring with its own tap, near the shower facilities, and we were hoping to do the same this time, but no luck. We ended up travelling further than we had planned but finally we saw a gap and pulled in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It soon became apparent why the space was available. There seemed to be an obstacle underwater, preventing us from getting parallel with the tow path. I stayed with Liberty Belle and Tony searched for a better mooring but the only space available was for Winter Mooring Permit holders. Oh well, beggars can't be choosers!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;If you say so....&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Now this sounds sensible.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;So far though, it's just a building site.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the crow flies, Kew gardens was very close to our mooring, so we decided to visit. Unfortunately we were on the wrong side of the Thames, so, being non-crow, we had to walk quite a long way to find a bridge to cross, then walk back along the river to the gardens, Oh well, it was a lovely day!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have both been to Kew Gardens on several occasions but we still managed to discover new treasures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;When we were children, there wasn't a play area here for us...&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;...so we made the most of it on this visit.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The view from the tree-top walk.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That night Liberty Belle somehow managed to find herself on top of the underwater obstacle. Oddly, just as we were leaving the EU, she suddenly lurched and ended up at a frightening angle, dangling off this hidden ledge! We both woke with a start. Tony leapt into action and went outside to shove at the boat, finally succeeding in getting us floating again. (I remained in the bed, supervising things from there...)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following day Tony went in search of somewhere more suitable to tie up. There was still a space at the Winter Moorings and, strictly speaking, although the permit holders have priority, other boats can moor there if a space is available. Clearly, no one was using this space...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We slid in, hoping that no-one with a permit would move us on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were expecting Joe and Carter to arrive the following day and we were now in a more convenient spot, nearer to the railway station. As it turned out, we also had a surprise visit from Robin and Julie on their way home from a trip to London. What a sociable day!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n70/IMG-20200202-WA0003.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;21&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Oh no!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Is this the end of Maggot...? *&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joe's plan was to work while he was staying with us, by either going into the office (near St. Pauls) or working from the boat.&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;On the first morning Joe went into London for the day and our only tasks were&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;look after the puppy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;collect water.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, 1) was simple, tiring, but simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as 2) was concerned, we decided to wait until a break in the rain before setting off for the tap just before the nearby lock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, a boat passed us, heading in that direction. We were concerned that he would pinch our space on his way back from the tap if we vacated it so we waited....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After quite some time Tony went off to see what had happened to the boat and found it moored at the lock. Ok, that meant we were safe to go!
Before we set off, another boat passed us. Oh, for goodness' sake!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We waited for him to return...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We did, finally, move to the lock, turn, stop at the tap and fill up with water, then return to 'our' mooring, but it took all day! We hoped Joe's day had been more productive...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once we had spent a few days in Brentford we moved on, back through Hanwell, then turned onto the Paddington Arm.  In front of us were 2 very slow boats, so we gradually made our way to Greenford in a frustratingly sedate convoy. There we found a very nice 14 day mooring near a pub...&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The Birds are gathering....&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;We did see a tree full of cormorants. We have never seen that before...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;...but we have no photo of that, so here are some crows.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Turning onto the Paddington Arm...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n70/P1290630.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;27&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;... we've got ourselves a convoy!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst we were moored in Greenford, Joe had another day in town and John &amp;amp; Melissa caught up with us. We decided to make use of the dog friendly pub for our meal. Sadly it was too dog friendly, with dogs wandering about and demanding treats from the besotted barmaid. Carter found this far too distracting and therefore so did we!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once Joe and Carter had headed for home, we decided to stay in Greenford for a while.
We had another day out in London, a day of sitting tight for storm Ciara and a day hunting the Gruffalo in the woods nearby.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, on a sunny morning, we headed for our 7 day pre-booked mooring in Paddington Basin. We had decided to take the stress out of our visit by reserving (and paying for) a mooring through the Canal &amp;amp; River Trust online booking system....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Was it worth booking?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, that's another story...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Where Next?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are currently North of London exploring the Lee Navigation and the River Stort. We will need to return the way we came, back to London, where we will brave the tidal section of the Thames.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we survive that and Liberty Belle is still afloat, we hope to travel down the Basingstoke Canal, followed by the River Wey.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our first task on the morning of 20th was to get Liberty Belle to a tap. Fortunately we had enough water in the kettle for a morning cuppa.... then off we went!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are signs of spring now. Some leaf buds in the hedges, a little blossom here and there as well as some birds, heron and coots in particular, thinking about pairing up and nesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;...probably built by a rich landowner.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We just managed to squeeze Liberty Belle into a space next to a very popular tap!
Whilst waiting for our turn we met&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;a musician who has lived on boats for years, both here and in Spain. He tried living in a house for a while but couldn't do it and went back to a boat. He was waiting for a gap near the tap for his boat and meanwhile was having a cuppa on another boat in the queue.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;a boater who's car engine had become waterlogged. The RAC van arrived at the tap and we all watched the proceedings.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;the owner of a small plastic boat (the shape of which you could just make out underneath all his 'stuff') who was looking for somewhere to empty his toilet. &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After filling our water tank we moved off to the next lock but the small plastic boat had beaten us to it. If it had been a narrowboat we could have shared the lock, but Liberty Belle would probably crush a little boat like that, so we let him go ahead. He started operating the lock with a spanner.....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was too painful to watch so I suggested he get back on board his boat and let me do the work using my windlass. Meanwhile, Tony went to fetch one of our spares and gave it to him. &quot;'ow much do yer want for it?&quot; was his response as he took it. Tony explained that he was welcome to it but has a feeling he has probably sold it since....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having seen the chap through the lock we passed through it ourselves and moored in a space underneath a railway bridge. As we arrived, the boat in front of us was leaving. I hoped it wasn't us he was escaping from but he explained he was leaving because of &quot;all the pigeon shit&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh. I see. Good point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On our travels over the next few days we stopped and investigated Watford, Rickmansworth, the village of Harefield and a couple of Nature Reserves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first was Cassiobury Park, originally the grounds of an abbey, then a manor house. Over the years, as parts of the land came up for sale, they were purchased by the council and became a public park.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second was Stockers Lake Nature Reserve, the site of old gravel pits, now flooded, with wide paths, visitor facilities and lots of water birds to see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One morning, after passing through a lock, I was just closing the gates, (which were very heavy), when Tony called back to tell me there was a boat coming, so I swung one of the gates back open. Walking along the towpath I realised the oncoming boat had pulled in. On speaking to the owner it was immediately obvious that he had had something rather more interesting for breakfast than I had! He seemed to think it was hilarious that I had left the gate open.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;conversationlisten&quot;&gt;&quot;I get told off for leaving gates open!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;conversationtalk&quot;&gt;&quot;Sorry I thought you were going into the lock..... Are you going into the lock?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;conversationlisten&quot;&gt;&quot;I am Babe, I am going into the lock, I am.&quot; (Much laughter...)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;conversationtalk&quot;&gt;&quot;So, I left it open for you.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;conversationlisten&quot;&gt;&quot;I get told off for leaving gates open!&quot; (Much more laughter...)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;conversationtalk&quot;&gt;&quot;Ok, bye! Have a good day!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I was to find out, it is a local habit to leave the gates and paddles up when you exit the locks around here. So much so, that the Canal &amp;amp; River Trust have put signs on the locks to remind people. So annoying! Maybe if I start adding a little something to my muesli I would find it funnier...&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;It certainly has a fair sized village pond...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;oh, and an internationally renowned heart &amp;amp; lung hospital.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We spent some time looking for the church in Harefield, which turned out to be at the bottom of Church Hill, which we thought was unusual. Attached to the church is a Military Cemetery containing 120 graves of Australian servicemen from the First World War. The Harefield Hospital was originally set up for Australians wounded in Europe and 50,000 of them were cared for there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The unique scroll-shaped headstones were designed by people from the hospital before the War Graves Commission introduced the usual, more simple design.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;I decided not to add our bin to this lot...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Great fun for kayaks but poor Liberty Belle struggled past, just missing a moored boat by inches...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;I wasn't planning to swim in the canal anyway...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our next planned stop was in Uxbridge. We arrived to find that all the mooring spaces were taken so we had to keep moving. We found a place to tie up outside an industrial estate a little further down the canal. We were still within walking distance of Uxbridge town, so we toured the charity shops to buy some toys for Cocker Spaniel Carter who was due to visit soon. Whilst there we hatched a plan to travel by train into London the following day. At the start of our journey we discovered that we hadn't emptied our rucksack properly after our shopping spree the day before, and had a small stowaway....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To avoid the rush hour crowds and train prices, we decided to find a pub to while away some time. Unfortunately, it was also rush hour in the pubs! Eventually we found one with a couple of spare stools. The two other people seated at the table welcomed us. They were train drivers and RMT representatives who had been at a meeting earlier in the day and were the two most drunk men we had seen in a very long time! We had a short conversation with them which was repeated many times and successfully entertained us for quite a while... When we left them, both Tony and I were hugged and kissed goodbye by them both. They had already been there for about 5 hours and showed no inclination to leave!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;3rd - 19th January 2020&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/maps/n68map.png&quot; alt=&quot;Our route&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Our route&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n68/P1290365.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A pile of hundreds of empty mussel shells crammed into a corner of a lock gate.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Empty mussel shells crammed into a lock gate.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Odd...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, with the festive season behind us, (feeling somewhat heavier and less fit, as is traditional), we journeyed back to Marsworth where we had left Liberty Belle. We try not to worry about abandoning our boat but it is always a relief when we find her exactly where we left her, safe and sound, with nothing missing...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had to walk a couple of miles or so from Tring railway station so we hadn't packed any food from home, and there was no food on board, so we were obliged to eat in the local pub.... Shame!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following morning we travelled through 7 locks and found a mooring on the outskirts of Berkhamsted. Still having no food, we walked into the town, ate in a pub again (what a bad habit), then walked back via Waitrose where we picked up a few bits. We pulled Liberty Belle over at the 2 hour shopping mooring right outside Waitrose as we passed by the next morning and stocked up properly. So far so good!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n68/P1290362.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Cowroast lock. Last time we came the new wood was quite red with black writing on it. This time the timer is a silver grey.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Cowroast Lock.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Last time we were here, these gates were brand new. It is already showing signs of weathering.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n68/P1290363.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A verty rotten lock gate with a orange painted steel brace.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;A little further along the canal, this lock gate must surely be next on the list for replacement!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, out of nowhere, we had our first experience of canal rage! On a wide stretch of canal we saw a boat heading towards us. There was plenty of room but the oncoming boat didn't seem to be taking advantage of the width, heading straight for us. Tony gradually moved more and more to the right, closer and closer to the fishermen lining the towpath. Strangely, the other boat seemed to be hugging the towpath too. Suddenly he started shouting at Tony, demanding that he use his common sense and pass on the other side! One of the fishermen, assuming that boats should stay on the left, as cars do, joined in! Many words were exchanged....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The boats just managed to miss each other and no fishing equipment was damaged but it was quite an episode, albeit a slow motion one! We still don't know what it was all about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We moored in Berkhamsted for several days outside The Rising Sun, known to the locals and boaters as &quot;The Riser&quot;, a pub we came across last time we were here and rather like!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n68/20200106-IMGP0011.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Rachel stood in front of the canalside Rising Sun pub at Berkhamstead&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Outside the pub...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n68/20200108-IMGP0002.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A poster outside the pub reading 'The Rsing Sun. There's nothing for You Here' with characters from the TV series 'League of Gentlemen'&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;...where a warm welcome awaits....??&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n68/IMG_20200105_170040278.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A single flocked decoration on the wall reading 'Christmas at the Rising Sun'&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The full extent of the Christmas decorations in the Rising Sun...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Impressive.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Berkhamsted is a pleasant town with proper shops, an excellent community cafe, some historical interest and plenty of walks in the hills around, so we weren't short of things to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walking around the area we came across a monument to the 3rd Duke of Bridgewater who created the first canals to carry coal from his mines in Worsley. (We visited the wharf there during one of  Mary's visits.) It seems the family seat was the Ashridge Estate, near Berkhamsted. The monument was built quite some time after his death and the widow of his successor, who was resident at the time, insisted that the monument was erected far enough away from the house to prevent her from seeing it because she found it so ugly. I have to sympathise with her....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n68/IMG_20200106_100803632.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A wooden sign with footpath arrows pointing in all directions.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Footpaths every which way.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;We found it but it was, of course, closed...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having explored Berkhamstead we moved to Hemel Hempstead where we stayed for a few days whilst storm Brendan blew itself (himself?) out.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n68/20200112-IMGP0026.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Liberty Belle moored between two other boats on a wide, peaceful bit of canal near a lock.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Our mooring in Hemel Heampstead.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hemel Hempstead has much to admire. It has a wide pedestrianised town centre with a variety of shops and long strip down the middle dedicated to children's play areas and various types of seating, some of which are under cover. On this main street is the entrance to a covered shopping centre which has a soft play area, comfortable seating and toilet facilities with large cubicles for family use, changing facilities with a hoist, large enough for use by an adult, curtained babyfeeding cubicles with comfy armchairs and a small kitchen with microwave. Beat that!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What's more, there is a long strip of garden following the river, which separates the main shopping street from the car parks, which are well hidden from sight as you stroll along the winding path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wouldn't suggest it is somewhere to go out of your way for, but if you are in the area, Hemel Hempstead is worth a look.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Part Canada and part Greylag.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Well, well, well!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our wanderings we also found the historic town of Old Hemel Hempstead which still has its own high street with some interesting old buildings as well as a delightful public park and play area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n68/IMG_20200118_143744276_HDR.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Tony stood by the oron railing in Old Hemel Hempstaed with a haf timbered house in the background.&quot; /&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;16th Century Charter Tower and walled garden is all that is left of a mansion in the Old Town.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Near our mooring space was the SunnySide Farm Shop and Cafe where a charity employs adults with learning difficulties to grow and sell produce, look after the hens, and run the cafe. We felt we should support them so we bought a loaf of bread, some expensive, tiny eggs and some extremely expensive washing-up liquid refill. I just hope it's super-concentrated!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One day, in search of a launderette, we walked along the canal to visit Kings Langley. On the way back we stopped at a cafe boat where we had tea and cake whilst listening to the owner's unfavourable opinion of the Canal &amp;amp; River Trust. It seems that they have made it difficult for him to run his business. Shame on them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the weather was more favourable we moved Liberty Belle to Kings Langley.
Joe was hoping to meet up with us so we walked from KIngs Langley to Watford looking out for a suitable mooring space on the way. We needed a parking space near by as well as easy access to a railway station so that Joe could spend the day working in London.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On our walk we came across a boat that was straddling the canal, its back mooring pins having worked their way out of the sodden ground, and the front pins were only just holding too. It was effectively blocking passage for any other boats as well as being in danger of drifting off. Tony contacted the Canal &amp;amp; River Trust to explain the situation and they contacted the owners. That was our good deed for the day done!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We returned from Watford on the train, having concluded that Liberty Belle was already in the best position.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following day we had a nose around Kings Langley where we found a church cafe selling excellent cakes and a fish and chip shop! Not a bad day!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joe and his puppy, Carter, joined us that evening and stayed for a couple of nights. During the day Joe went into work by train and we got to play with Carter!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;What's this over here?&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;What's that over there?&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;This way. No, that way.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Backwards, forwards,&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;upwards, downwards,&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;here, there,&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Walking a puppy.....!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Joe and Carter had gone back to their normal lives, we decided to follow in Joe's footsteps and take a train into London for the day. We saw the Wallace Collection, which is well worth a visit, caught up with Robin, walked along the river and took in the views from level 10 in the Tate Modern. It was a pleasant, sunny, satisfying day but tiring. When we got back on the boat we just managed to have a shower each before we completely ran out of water! Oh well, we will have to move tomorrow to find the next tap...&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The Wallace Collection had a carving of a man with a Calder &amp;amp; Hebble handspike!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;What are the chances?&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Where Next?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are gradually making our way into London, as slowly as our water supply will allow, hoping that we will find suitable moorings as we go. In the spring we tentatively plan to travel North up the rivers Lee and Stort then, (via the Thames), tackle the River Wey and Basingstoke canal, followed by the Thames to Lechlade.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rachel Glombek</name></author><category term="LibertyBelle" /><summary type="html">From Marsworth to Kings Langley 3rd - 19th January 2020</summary></entry></feed>
