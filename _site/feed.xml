&lt;h2&gt;20th-28th January 2020&lt;/h2&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our first task on the morning of 20th was to get Liberty Belle to a tap. Fortunately we had enough water in the kettle for a morning cuppa.... then off we went!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are signs of spring now. Some leaf buds in the hedges, a little blossom here and there as well as some birds, heron and coots in particular, thinking about pairing up and nesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n69/P1290409.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;2&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Now we are inside the London Orbital!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n69/P1290421.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;4&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;An even prettier bridge...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n69/P1290427.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;5&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;...probably built by a rich landowner.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We just managed to squeeze Liberty Belle into a space next to a very popular tap!
Whilst waiting for our turn we met&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;a musician who has lived on boats for years, both here and in Spain. He tried living in a house for a while but couldn't do it and went back to a boat. He was waiting for a gap near the tap for his boat and meanwhile was having a cuppa on another boat in the queue.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;a boater who's car engine had become waterlogged. The RAC van arrived at the tap and we all watched the proceedings.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;the owner of a small plastic boat (the shape of which you could just make out underneath all his 'stuff') who was looking for somewhere to empty his toilet. &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After filling our water tank we moved off to the next lock but the small plastic boat had beaten us to it. If it had been a narrowboat we could have shared the lock, but Liberty Belle would probably crush a little boat like that, so we let him go ahead. He started operating the lock with a spanner.....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was too painful to watch so I suggested he get back on board his boat and let me do the work using my windlass. Meanwhile, Tony went to fetch one of our spares and gave it to him. &quot;'ow much do yer want for it?&quot; was his response as he took it. Tony explained that he was welcome to it but has a feeling he has probably sold it since....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having seen the chap through the lock we passed through it ourselves and moored in a space underneath a railway bridge. As we arrived, the boat in front of us was leaving. I hoped it wasn't us he was escaping from but he explained he was leaving because of &quot;all the pigeon shit&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh. I see. Good point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On our travels over the next few days we stopped and investigated Watford, Rickmansworth, the village of Harefield and a couple of Nature Reserves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first was Cassiobury Park, originally the grounds of an abbey, then a manor house. Over the years, as parts of the land came up for sale, they were purchased by the council and became a public park.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second was Stockers Lake Nature Reserve, the site of old gravel pits, now flooded, with wide paths, visitor facilities and lots of water birds to see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Collecting water on our way.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One morning, after passing through a lock, I was just closing the gates, (which were very heavy), when Tony called back to tell me there was a boat coming, so I swung one of the gates back open. Walking along the towpath I realised the oncoming boat had pulled in. On speaking to the owner it was immediately obvious that he had had something rather more interesting for breakfast than I had! He seemed to think it was hilarious that I had left the gate open.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;conversationlisten&quot;&gt;&quot;I get told off for leaving gates open!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;conversationtalk&quot;&gt;&quot;Sorry I thought you were going into the lock..... Are you going into the lock?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;conversationlisten&quot;&gt;&quot;I am Babe, I am going into the lock, I am.&quot; (Much laughter...)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;conversationtalk&quot;&gt;&quot;So, I left it open for you.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;conversationlisten&quot;&gt;&quot;I get told off for leaving gates open!&quot; (Much more laughter...)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;conversationtalk&quot;&gt;&quot;Ok, bye! Have a good day!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I was to find out, it is a local habit to leave the gates and paddles up when you exit the locks around here. So much so, that the Canal &amp;amp; River Trust have put signs on the locks to remind people. So annoying! Maybe if I start adding a little something to my muesli I would find it funnier...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n69/P1290500.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;14&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;...or just leave it for Rachel to sort out. Hurrumph!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Harefield.

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;It certainly has a fair sized village pond...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;oh, and an internationally renowned heart &amp;amp; lung hospital.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We spent some time looking for the church in Harefield, which turned out to be at the bottom of Church Hill, which we thought was unusual. Attached to the church is a Military Cemetery containing 120 graves of Australian servicemen from the First World War. The Harefield Hospital was originally set up for Australians wounded in Europe and 50,000 of them were cared for there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The unique scroll-shaped headstones were designed by people from the hospital before the War Graves Commission introduced the usual, more simple design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;I decided not to add our bin to this lot...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n69/IMG-20200125-WA0000.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;21&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Great fun for kayaks but poor Liberty Belle struggled past, just missing a moored boat by inches...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;I wasn't planning to swim in the canal anyway...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our next planned stop was in Uxbridge. We arrived to find that all the mooring spaces were taken so we had to keep moving. We found a place to tie up outside an industrial estate a little further down the canal. We were still within walking distance of Uxbridge town, so we toured the charity shops to buy some toys for Cocker Spaniel Carter who was due to visit soon. Whilst there we hatched a plan to travel by train into London the following day. At the start of our journey we discovered that we hadn't emptied our rucksack properly after our shopping spree the day before, and had a small stowaway....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To avoid the rush hour crowds and train prices, we decided to find a pub to while away some time. Unfortunately, it was also rush hour in the pubs! Eventually we found one with a couple of spare stools. The two other people seated at the table welcomed us. They were train drivers and RMT representatives who had been at a meeting earlier in the day and were the two most drunk men we had seen in a very long time! We had a short conversation with them which was repeated many times and successfully entertained us for quite a while... When we left them, both Tony and I were hugged and kissed goodbye by them both. They had already been there for about 5 hours and showed no inclination to leave!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the moment we are on our way up the River Lee.  After a diversion along the River Stort we will return to London before tackling the Basingstoke Canal and River Wey, all being well....!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rachel Glombek</name></author><category term="LibertyBelle" /><summary type="html">From Kings Langley to Uxbridge 20th-28th January 2020</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">All the Rage.</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/libertybellenewsletter/libertybelle/2020/01/29/all-the-rage.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="All the Rage." /><published>2020-01-29T19:51:00+00:00</published><updated>2020-01-29T19:51:00+00:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/libertybellenewsletter/libertybelle/2020/01/29/all-the-rage</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/libertybellenewsletter/libertybelle/2020/01/29/all-the-rage.html">&lt;h2&gt;From Marsworth to Kings Langley&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3rd - 19th January 2020&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/maps/n68map.png&quot; alt=&quot;Our route&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Our route&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n68/P1290365.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A pile of hundreds of empty mussel shells crammed into a corner of a lock gate.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Empty mussel shells crammed into a lock gate.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Odd...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, with the festive season behind us, (feeling somewhat heavier and less fit, as is traditional), we journeyed back to Marsworth where we had left Liberty Belle. We try not to worry about abandoning our boat but it is always a relief when we find her exactly where we left her, safe and sound, with nothing missing...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had to walk a couple of miles or so from Tring railway station so we hadn't packed any food from home, and there was no food on board, so we were obliged to eat in the local pub.... Shame!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following morning we travelled through 7 locks and found a mooring on the outskirts of Berkhamsted. Still having no food, we walked into the town, ate in a pub again (what a bad habit), then walked back via Waitrose where we picked up a few bits. We pulled Liberty Belle over at the 2 hour shopping mooring right outside Waitrose as we passed by the next morning and stocked up properly. So far so good!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n68/P1290362.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Cowroast lock. Last time we came the new wood was quite red with black writing on it. This time the timer is a silver grey.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Cowroast Lock.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Last time we were here, these gates were brand new. It is already showing signs of weathering.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n68/P1290363.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A verty rotten lock gate with a orange painted steel brace.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;A little further along the canal, this lock gate must surely be next on the list for replacement!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, out of nowhere, we had our first experience of canal rage! On a wide stretch of canal we saw a boat heading towards us. There was plenty of room but the oncoming boat didn't seem to be taking advantage of the width, heading straight for us. Tony gradually moved more and more to the right, closer and closer to the fishermen lining the towpath. Strangely, the other boat seemed to be hugging the towpath too. Suddenly he started shouting at Tony, demanding that he use his common sense and pass on the other side! One of the fishermen, assuming that boats should stay on the left, as cars do, joined in! Many words were exchanged....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The boats just managed to miss each other and no fishing equipment was damaged but it was quite an episode, albeit a slow motion one! We still don't know what it was all about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We moored in Berkhamsted for several days outside The Rising Sun, known to the locals and boaters as &quot;The Riser&quot;, a pub we came across last time we were here and rather like!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n68/20200106-IMGP0011.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Rachel stood in front of the canalside Rising Sun pub at Berkhamstead&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Outside the pub...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n68/20200108-IMGP0002.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A poster outside the pub reading 'The Rsing Sun. There's nothing for You Here' with characters from the TV series 'League of Gentlemen'&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;...where a warm welcome awaits....??&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Berkhamsted is a pleasant town with proper shops, an excellent community cafe, some historical interest and plenty of walks in the hills around, so we weren't short of things to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walking around the area we came across a monument to the 3rd Duke of Bridgewater who created the first canals to carry coal from his mines in Worsley. (We visited the wharf there during one of  Mary's visits.) It seems the family seat was the Ashridge Estate, near Berkhamsted. The monument was built quite some time after his death and the widow of his successor, who was resident at the time, insisted that the monument was erected far enough away from the house to prevent her from seeing it because she found it so ugly. I have to sympathise with her....&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;We found it but it was, of course, closed...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having explored Berkhamstead we moved to Hemel Hempstead where we stayed for a few days whilst storm Brendan blew itself (himself?) out.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Our mooring in Hemel Heampstead.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hemel Hempstead has much to admire. It has a wide pedestrianised town centre with a variety of shops and long strip down the middle dedicated to children's play areas and various types of seating, some of which are under cover. On this main street is the entrance to a covered shopping centre which has a soft play area, comfortable seating and toilet facilities with large cubicles for family use, changing facilities with a hoist, large enough for use by an adult, curtained babyfeeding cubicles with comfy armchairs and a small kitchen with microwave. Beat that!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What's more, there is a long strip of garden following the river, which separates the main shopping street from the car parks, which are well hidden from sight as you stroll along the winding path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wouldn't suggest it is somewhere to go out of your way for, but if you are in the area, Hemel Hempstead is worth a look.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Well, well, well!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our wanderings we also found the historic town of Old Hemel Hempstead which still has its own high street with some interesting old buildings as well as a delightful public park and play area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n68/IMG_20200118_143744276_HDR.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Tony stood by the oron railing in Old Hemel Hempstaed with a haf timbered house in the background.&quot; /&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;16th Century Charter Tower and walled garden is all that is left of a mansion in the Old Town.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Near our mooring space was the SunnySide Farm Shop and Cafe where a charity employs adults with learning difficulties to grow and sell produce, look after the hens, and run the cafe. We felt we should support them so we bought a loaf of bread, some expensive, tiny eggs and some extremely expensive washing-up liquid refill. I just hope it's super-concentrated!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One day, in search of a launderette, we walked along the canal to visit Kings Langley. On the way back we stopped at a cafe boat where we had tea and cake whilst listening to the owner's unfavourable opinion of the Canal &amp;amp; River Trust. It seems that they have made it difficult for him to run his business. Shame on them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the weather was more favourable we moved Liberty Belle to Kings Langley.
Joe was hoping to meet up with us so we walked from KIngs Langley to Watford looking out for a suitable mooring space on the way. We needed a parking space near by as well as easy access to a railway station so that Joe could spend the day working in London.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On our walk we came across a boat that was straddling the canal, its back mooring pins having worked their way out of the sodden ground, and the front pins were only just holding too. It was effectively blocking passage for any other boats as well as being in danger of drifting off. Tony contacted the Canal &amp;amp; River Trust to explain the situation and they contacted the owners. That was our good deed for the day done!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We returned from Watford on the train, having concluded that Liberty Belle was already in the best position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n68/IMG_20200115_132106642_HDR.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A narrowboat straddles the canal while Tony talks on the phone.&quot; /&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Kings Langley, home of the Ovaltinies!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following day we had a nose around Kings Langley where we found a church cafe selling excellent cakes and a fish and chip shop! Not a bad day!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joe and his puppy, Carter, joined us that evening and stayed for a couple of nights. During the day Joe went into work by train and we got to play with Carter!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n68/IMG-20200117-WA0014.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Rachel with Carter the cocker spaniel sniffing at the full extent of his lead.&quot; /&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;What's that over there?&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;This way. No, that way.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;upwards, downwards,&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;here, there,&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Walking a puppy.....!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Joe and Carter had gone back to their normal lives, we decided to follow in Joe's footsteps and take a train into London for the day. We saw the Wallace Collection, which is well worth a visit, caught up with Robin, walked along the river and took in the views from level 10 in the Tate Modern. It was a pleasant, sunny, satisfying day but tiring. When we got back on the boat we just managed to have a shower each before we completely ran out of water! Oh well, we will have to move tomorrow to find the next tap...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Where Next?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are gradually making our way into London, as slowly as our water supply will allow, hoping that we will find suitable moorings as we go. In the spring we tentatively plan to travel North up the rivers Lee and Stort then, (via the Thames), tackle the River Wey and Basingstoke canal, followed by the Thames to Lechlade.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rachel Glombek</name></author><category term="LibertyBelle" /><summary type="html">From Marsworth to Kings Langley 3rd - 19th January 2020</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">‘Driving Home for Christmas’</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/libertybellenewsletter/libertybelle/2020/01/08/driving-home-for-christmas.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="'Driving Home for Christmas'" /><published>2020-01-08T17:27:00+00:00</published><updated>2020-01-08T17:27:00+00:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/libertybellenewsletter/libertybelle/2020/01/08/driving-home-for-christmas</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/libertybellenewsletter/libertybelle/2020/01/08/driving-home-for-christmas.html">&lt;h2&gt;From Brinklow to Marsworth Junction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3rd - 17th December 2019&lt;/h2&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;...at Hillmorton by Peter Coates in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had been banished to the house for an uncertain amount of time whilst waiting to hear from the boatyard. Liberty Belle's dry dock in Brinklow was actually an old widebeam hull with a lift-up section at the front which can be raised to let water in and allow a narrowboat to be driven inside. Being a boat itself, the dry dock can be floated into position behind the boat that is going to enter it. The front section is then lowered back into place and the water pumped out, allowing access to the narrowboat's hull. Genius.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are baffled by my description of the dry dock and want to know what it is really like, this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TiOyp4xkLfs&quot;&gt;YouTube video of Brinklow's Floating Dry Dock&lt;/a&gt; might help &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To cut a long story short, Liberty Belle didn't have her propeller repaired but instead, had her original propeller, (replaced some time in the past and housed in the engine bay), re-fitted. Her bottom was blacked (in two stages because of unfavourable weather conditions) and a few other little jobs completed that had been recommended when we had her survey done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, on Wednesday 11th December, she was ready to be collected. We drove back in the hire car to a convenient parking space where the road meets the canal, near Brinklow, and walked the muddy route to the boatyard where she was waiting for us. Once on board, we eased our way between all the moored boats to the end of the arm, turned and headed off to the parking space where we loaded the contents of the car into the boat. Tony then drove the hire car into Brinklow, parked and walked back to the boat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n67/20200108-IMGP0010.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Our brass propeller showing a bent blade.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;This is the bent propeller that was removed. The blade on the left shouldn't have a hump in it.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Off we went to Rugby. Initially we weren't very impressed by the propeller, as we seemed to be struggling, but it turned out that we had picked up a large sheet of plastic that was causing the problem. Once that was removed we were off like a shot! With her original propeller in place, Liberty Belle seemed much faster. Apparently, the one that was in place when we bought her was designed to be equally efficient for travelling forwards or in reverse.... As we spend most of our time cruising forwards, hopefully we gain more than we lose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We moored overnight in Rugby and the following morning Tony caught a bus to Brinklow, collected the hire car and returned it to Enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; We then set off for Hillmorton locks, where one of the pounds was short of water, which slowed us down a bit whilst we topped it up. 
The following morning we arrived outside the chandlers in Braunston just as they were opening and bought ourselves 12 bags of coal. (They store their coal indoors here, so it stays dry. Last year we had a lot of wet coal which doesn't create much heat....you live and learn.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we made our way through Braunston we were greeted by a very friendly lady who had heard about us from our newsletter friends, Lin and Charles. It was exciting to be recognised, we felt like celebrities! We didn't have time to stop though, because we had promised ourselves a curry in Weedon Bec if we got there early enough....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, through Braunston Locks and Tunnel, to Norton Junction. Through 7 locks there, (including the one we nearly sank in, right back at the beginning), which were heavy and difficult, partly due to an excess of water.  Then, finally, we arrived! Not only were we in time for a meal out, but we were able to go for a leisurely drink beforehand too. It was our third visit to this particular Indian Restaurant - we are practically regulars!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n67/P1290266.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Bags of coal piled up in the bow and covered with a nylon waterproof cover.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Doesn't everyone keep their coal under a bike cover?&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n67/P1290274.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A view back from the stern of Liberty Belle from inside a lock.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;It feels good to be travelling again.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Wall to wall *&amp;amp;%$£@ geese! The photo doesn't do justice to the numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following day was very windy but we soldiered on regardless, which was a mistake. At one of the locks Tony brought Liberty Belle into the side and held onto her centre rope as it was too windy to just drift about waiting for me to open the gate. There was a sudden gust of wind which took him by surprise and he fell backwards, giving himself a large bump on the back of his head. I was rather worried, thinking he might suddenly collapse later in the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it turned out, we were joined by another boat, so he was kept chatting by the helmsman (or rather, woman), so at least she would notice if something was wrong. Her partner, working the locks with me, was also quite chatty, so we were both entertained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The young couple had met doing the Argentine Tango, which takes them all over the world (I guess they don't tango all the way there and back...). They decided to give up their rented flat in London and buy a boat to live on instead. They work from home and only need to be in London occasionally so it suits them well. They were very up-beat, happy and pleasant people. Their boat is called 'So Long'; see what they did there?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We finished the day by eating leftover curry. It was just as yummy as it had been the day before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tony didn't suffer any ill effects from his accident and the egg-sized lump gradually went away over the next couple of days. Another lesson learnt (possibly) - tie your boat securely when waiting for a lock...&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The weather slowly cheered up over the next two days and we had several sightings of deer and kingfishers. We passed through Milton Keynes without stopping, as we wanted to get a little nearer to Berkhamsted where the canal was due to close for repairs on 7th January. We didn't want to be under too much pressure immediately after Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Marsworth we found an ideal mooring; amongst other boats, outside a private house with plenty of people passing backwards and forwards. We decided that Liberty Belle would be safe there for the two weeks over Christmas. It did mean we had over 2 miles to walk along the muddy towpath to get to the railway station the following morning, but we travelled light and got there in plenty of time to catch our train to Eastleigh. (Chandlers Ford station was closed because of rail strikes...)&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;*Apparently there is some doubt about the name of the Cosgrove bridge.
In Feb 1996 the Parish Clerk tries to cover his arse in a local newsletter....&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The image reads...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;ORNAMENTAL BRIDGE - BRIDGE ROAD: As neither British Waterways, Village historians nor Older residents can agree, i.e., Solomons or Samsons Bridge. (British Waterways, know it as Solomons Bridge but can't confirm the origin of that name). The clerk to avoid embarassment and, in an attempt to remain neutral as a non resident, intends to refer to it by the above title from now on. As you read this, it is hoped that work has already commenced on the bridge and its approaches as previously reported.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Where Next?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are currently moored in Berkhamsted and have been exploring the local area. As yet we haven't done any planning at all! We will let you know when we have.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&quot;Birmingham has more canals than Venice, but I know where I'd rather be...&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A quote from a friend. (You know who you are!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We, in contrast, were very enthusiastic about the adventure ahead of us as we set off from Cambrian Wharf, looking forward to the twists and turns, loops and junctions of the Birmingham Navigations. We had read that, although not known for their beauty, these canals were interesting from an industrial point of view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It all started well, round the Port Loop, the Soho Loop, up the pretty Smethwick Locks and across the beautiful Aqueduct onto the Engine arm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n66/P1280553.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Such pretty iron footbridges.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n66/P1280466.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;2&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Smart new housing on the Port Loop.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n66/P1280500cropped.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;3&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;A little canine gongoozler.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our first tiny hiccup was having to be towed around the turning space at the end by a kind gentleman whose boat is moored there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst we stood on the stern watching him haul us around, we chatted about the large old warehouse opposite his boat. Apparently it is a listed building which has been strengthened inside to preserve it. The outside remains untouched, including a protruding wooden structure. The man said it would inevitably fall at some point and he just hoped it missed his boat when it did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanking our helper, we moved back across the aqueduct and then through the delightful Galton Valley, which makes you feel, (briefly), like you are in the middle of the countryside. This illusion is almost immediately shattered by the main roads criss-crossing overhead... Down below, The Old Main Line passes over the New Main Line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our next diversion was along the Titford Arm, up the Oldbury Locks to The Pumphouse. We planned to turn at the next winding hole but we didn't quite get that far. The canal proved to be too shallow for us, so we had to reverse the half mile back to the Pumphouse.  Well done, Tony, that was not an easy task!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A resident boater at the Pumphouse stood, with mug of tea in hand, and watched us backing up. He offered us a mooring for the night, for which we thanked him, but we insisted on returning down the lock flight, so he recommended some safe moorings. What a nice man.
We moored up at a pontoon that he mentioned. It is safe because you can't reach it on foot. It was sooo slippery that we couldn't have walked off if we tried!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple of days later we met a boater who had injured his knee in this very place. Ouch.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Travelling backwards....&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We then continued to twist our way around the network, moving from the Old Main Line, (the wiggly one), along the connecting Gower Branch onto the New Main Line, (the straight one), until we found our way onto the Walsall Canal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we travelled down the Ryders Green Locks which were easy to operate, once we got through the pallets. At the seventh lock we met a friendly group of people gathered around a shopping basket fire with their supply of booze and kindling. They warned us about the hidden obstacles in the canal ahead, advising us to stay strictly in the middle. Thanks to them we made it through to the visitor moorings in Walsall without incident, but it was slow going.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n66/P1280695.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;15&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;So many junctions!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n66/P1280699.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;16&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Ryders Green Locks.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Just shove yer way forwards!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n66/P1280720.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;17&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Fire extinguishers.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;We stopped counting them after a dozen.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n66/P1280725.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;18&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Something with 4 wheels...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walsall was bigger than I was expecting and looked interesting, so we decided to spend a day exploring. Some of our time was lost searching for the Museum. We tried following the tourist signs, some of which had been moved (people seem to enjoy this game). Finally we arrived at the library and asked an assistant. The museum we were seeking closed 5 years ago but the signs have been left up. Okaaayyyy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turned out that this wasn't the oddest thing about the town. On our travels we discovered St Paul's, which is part church and part shopping centre. It was converted in the 1990's and surely has to be unique.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also came across the 'Retail Multiples' which is an indoor market and Post Office, which is strange but seems to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the outskirts of the town there is the Walsall Arboretum, which is a public garden made on the site of a flooded limestone quarry. Oddly, it isn't an arboretum. At the time, it was fashionable for a town to have an arboretum, so that's what they called their park. This explanation is given, as if it makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We made our way to the visitor's centre where there was a craft sale, (well, that's what they called it), and a display of quilted wall-hangings, representing local villages. They were beautifully made and very slightly bonkers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a bit of sanity we visited the Art Gallery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n66/IMG_20191116_151429745_HDR.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;19&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;St Paul's still looks like a church from the outside&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n66/IMG_20191116_151446981.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;20&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;From the inside it looks like a shopping mall.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n66/IMG_20191116_152218545.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;21&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;It turns out that it is both.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n66/IMG_20191116_152053193.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;22&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;This chapel is still a place of public worship.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The entrance to the non-arboretum, with its display of poppies.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;This face pops up a lot around here.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;In this case he has been stitched onto a wall-hanging.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, after the un-reality check that is Walsall, we left our moorings and turned a corner straight into the Walsall flight of 8 locks. There was so little water that I had to go to the top lock to send enough down to keep Liberty Belle floating. It was a long job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the 7th lock, Liberty Belle got stuck half way in. Tony couldn't persuade her to go forwards or backwards. I tried flushing water at her but it didn't help. Meanwhile, the Wolverhampton Community Payback Team came to see what was going on. They were full of advice and tried to pull us out using the stern rope. This didn't work, so Tony rang the CRT for help and, whilst we were waiting for someone to ring him back, it was noticed that the boat had shifted slightly. Tony tried to reverse and she moved! A huge log bobbed up at the bow. It must have been wedged underneath between the entrance to the lock and Liberty Belle's bow. One of the team persuaded us to let him use our barge pole to try and move the log. He was successful and we were able to continue. Well done lads!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tony phoned the CRT to cancel our rescue. Finally we got through the last lock, arriving to the sound of loud singing and the sight of a parade with people of all ages waving flags and led by white horses!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turned out it wasn't for us, but a celebration of the Prophet Mohammed's birthday. I waved madly and a couple of people encouraged me to join in and come for the feast, but I thought of Tony waiting on the boat, and decided to decline!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We carried onto the Wyrley and Essington Canal. Nicknamed the Curley Wyrley it has some very tight corners under its bridges and is annoyingly shallow, but it has some pretty sections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n66/P1280738.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;25&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Phew. Made it to the top of the Walsall Locks.
What a morning!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n66/P1280748.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;26&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;A fridge...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n66/P1280753.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;27&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;A stretch of the Wyrley &amp;amp; Essington with pretty views and no rubbish.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n66/P1280754.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;28&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;We tied up to these convenient posts. &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We bypassed the Cannock Extension on this occasion and, turning at Catshill Junction, we went down the Daw End Canal. This leads into the Rushall Canal which was closed due to lock repairs, so we went as far as we could and turned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a night spent at a marina's visitor moorings we returned to the Catshill Junction which was frozen! This was a surprise and made turning the corner onto the Anglesey Branch very difficult, especially as a wheelie bin was frozen into the centre of the canal. We aborted our first attempt and Tony pulled Liberty Belle out of the ice by her stern rope. We started again, breaking up the ice with the boathook as we went so that Liberty Belle could swing round. It was slow and I was all for giving up but we managed and, as it turned out, the canal was very pretty and well worth a look.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the Anglesey Branch was the Chasewater Park, where we had a lunch stop before heading back to Catshill Junction to re-join the Curley Wyrley. The wheelie bin was still there but the ice had melted, thankfully!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time we went up the Cannock Extension which is as straight as an arrow, heading purposefully nowhere.  It was, however, very pretty in its autumn colours. We didn't go right to the end, but turned at some private moorings in an old colliery arm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So back on the Curley Wyrley, we got as far as Sneyd Junction where we were welcomed onto a mooring outside the facilities by a kind boater on long-term moorings there.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Just throw the old bed in the canal. It'll be fine.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n66/P1280925.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;45&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;There's a gap in the fence, very convenient for disposing of stuff you no longer want...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next little branch on our list was the Bradley Arm, (aka Wednesbury Oak Loop), which can be navigated all the way to the end during office hours. Otherwise, there is a winding hole part way along. This seemed so odd that we decided to play it safe and just went as far as the turning point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We decided that it should be easy going because the CRT's workshop is at the end, so they are bound to keep the canal clear. Famous last words!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The canal was very hard work. By the time we had given it the benefit of the doubt, it seemed a very long way to reverse back to the junction, so we soldiered on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We met a boat coming the other way, which was a complete shock as we hadn't seen a moving boat for ages! The helmsman warned us that it had taken him ages to turn at the winding hole. Great. With a boathook and lots of chugging backwards and forwards, we finally managed it.
Just as we were finally facing the right way, a gentleman on the towpath said there was an easier winding hole a few yards further along the canal. Oh well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually we arrived back on the Old Main Line canal, where we could travel at a reasonable speed - possibly even 3 miles an hour!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We made our way to the Black Country Museum visitor moorings and, because of the bad weather, we stayed for a couple of days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The Black Country Museum Visitor moorings.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst moored outside the museum, we went on a boat trip through the tunnels (a bit of a busman's holiday), where we tried 'legging' the boat. This is how boats used to travel through the tunnel. The horses were taken over the top and two or more men lay head to head along wooden boards placed across the boat, with their feet on the tunnel walls. They then walked along the tunnel walls to propel the boat forwards. Once we got going it was surprisingly easy. Of course we didn't have to do it for long...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On our second day we went into the Black Country Museum which is fascinating. We spent quite a lot of time chatting to the various 'historical characters' positioned around the museum in shops and houses. They were very chatty and full of interesting information. Mary is from this neck of the woods, with chain and anchor making being part of her history, so I found it all the more interesting for that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Is 11:30 too early?&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After our couple of days off we were anxious to make up a bit of time. So, via Tipton Green and Pudding Green junctions, we turned onto the Wednesbury Old Canal and back down the Ryders Green locks. Here we met a man who was walking his dog along the towpath. I told him that we had found all the people around here, in the Birmingham area, very friendly. That was a mistake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&quot;You're not in Birmingham now, Bab. This is the Black Country. Never call the Black Country Birmingham, we don't allow that.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think he forgave me though, because he opened a couple of lock gates for us. At lock 7 we were recognised by the group of drinkers gathered around their shopping basket fire, who welcomed us like old friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally we reached the Tame Valley Canal which is remarkably straight, with several aqueducts, but was disappointingly shallow. We slowly made our way to Perry Barr locks, hoping to get through at least some of them before mooring for the night. However, on inspection, it was obvious that the pounds were very low on water and a lot of time would be needed to fill them up. Liberty Belle was already positioned in a nice visitor mooring at the top, outside some boaters facilities, so we decided to tie up, stay put and tackle the locks early the following morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Immediately after breakfast I got into my wet weather gear and set off to start sending water down the locks. I was met by the wonderful sight of a Canal &amp;amp; River Trust employee already on the case! This very nice man not only helped us to work the locks but dashed backwards and forwards to the locks behind and in front of us, re-setting the paddles to allow water to pass down and filling each lock ready for us. He did all this in a cheerful way, chatting to us as he went. This was the first of several flights of locks he had to check that day. Apparently he had never been called a hero before!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During our chats, we discussed the rubbish we had seen in the local canals. He told us that 5 years ago the contract for cleaning the canals went to a company who do not possess a single boat. (As far as we know, Chris Grayling had nothing to do with the contract, on this occasion). As a consequence, they have only been able to remove rubbish from the edges. So now, there is 5 years worth of dumped rubbish waiting to be collected.... Good grief. You couldn't make it up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We reached Spaghetti Junction, which is far more amazing from underneath. The splash from the lorries going through deep puddles is more impressive too when it slops over the side of the road and comes down into the canal in a waterfall... All the fun of a very slow log flume ride!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We joined the Birmingham and Fazeley Canal at Salford junction and moored at the top of the Minworth Lock Flight.. We were cold, wet and hungry, and grateful for some dry clothes, a coal fire and a hot lunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Works as hard as a cat?&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;What? &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Star City. The site of recent violence.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple of days later we turned right onto the Coventry Canal at Fazeley Junction, which proved to be a lot easier than coming the other way. Now on the pretty section of the Coventry Canal we suddenly realised that the locks didn't need anti-vandal keys to operate them, the safety equipment was still in place and we had flower beds rather than rubbish bags to look at. On reflection, we were glad to be free of the Birmingham Navigations. We shan't need to go back there again!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also began to see other boats moving around. One very small boat with an outboard motor seemed anxious to overtake us. Apparently they were in a rush to get to London. We happily moved over so that they could pass. Their motor was thrashing away, creating an impressive wake but not really going much faster than we were, so we stared at their rear-end until we stopped in the delightful Polesworth for a late lunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following day we came across several locks which had been abandoned by the previous occupants with gates open and paddles up, which is very annoying. It seems the little boat in a hurry to get to London had saved themselves time and effort by leaving half their work for me to do! Charming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We braved frozen ropes, slippery surfaces and mooring pins frozen into the ground to get to the useful little town of Nuneaton. It’s main claim to fame seems to be George Eliot, who gets a mention at every turn.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;George Eliot, in drag...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next we joined the Oxford Canal at Hawkesbury junction and on to Brinklow where we moored just around the corner from the boatyard where Liberty Belle had an appointment with a dry dock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following morning, as we were trying to turn through the iced-over canal, we had a phone call from the engineer to check that we were on our way, reassuring us that, once we had passed under the railway bridge, he would see us and sort us out. Did he heck. He was having his tea break whilst we wondered where to go, what to do and where everyone was! Eventually Liberty Belle was settled into the dry dock and we were on the bus to Rugby, where we picked up our hire car and set off for the house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Where Next?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope you are all having a delightful festive season! We are at the house at the moment, enjoying the company of family and friends. We will be heading back to Liberty Belle in the New Year to move her on past some locks in Berkhamstead which will close from 7th January until the end of March. We will potter about in the area until the Spring, when we can set off again to explore the parts of the network that we missed out this year.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rachel Glombek</name></author><category term="LibertyBelle" /><summary type="html">From Birmingham to Brinklow 13th November - 2nd December 2019</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Brummagem Again!</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/libertybellenewsletter/libertybelle/2019/11/21/brummagem-again.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Brummagem Again!" /><published>2019-11-21T18:41:00+00:00</published><updated>2019-11-21T18:41:00+00:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/libertybellenewsletter/libertybelle/2019/11/21/brummagem-again</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/libertybellenewsletter/libertybelle/2019/11/21/brummagem-again.html">&lt;h2&gt;Birmingham&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4th - 13th November 2019&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n65/IMG-20191020-WA0003.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Liberty Belle moored alongside other residential boats at a wide wharf&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Liberty Belle moored in Cambrian Wharf.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;(Straight ahead is the Birmingham Arena)&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n65/IMG-20191108-WA0002.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Inside the back door of Liberty Belle are two matching shelves holding a pair of windlasses and a pair of mooring spikes.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Tony made us new windlass &amp;amp; mooring pin holders.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Posh.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After getting a few jobs done at the house, we returned to Birmingham, dropping off the faulty inverter on the way. Having already been moored for our 14 day allocation, we were ready to move Liberty Belle straight away and make room for another boat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we arrived we noticed that the other 14 day moorings were empty, so there certainly wasn't a queue! Tony contacted the Canal &amp;amp; River Trust to see whether they would allow us to stay until we had our inverter back from the repairers. They were agreeable, which meant Tony could easily travel by train to collect it. Fab!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, whilst we waited, we had a good look around the building site which is Birmingham City Centre. We do love Birmingham but it is surrounded by hoardings, scaffolding and apologies! I overheard someone saying that to get anywhere in Birmingham you have to go the long way round. That is so true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alongside exploring churches and museums, the Central Library and Botanic Gardens we were there to witness the switching on of the Christmas lights and the start of the German Christmas market, as well as the Remembrance Sunday Parade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year we attended a  Remembrance Sunday service around a village memorial, which was a small and very personal affair. This year, in the middle of a city, it was on a much larger scale and very formal. Very different and yet the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also included the occasional trip to the Briar Rose (our nearest Wetherspoons), The Wellington Specialist Real Ale Pub (of course) and the Damascena Coffee House, (my personal favourite).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The Christmas tree is actually a pile of small trees.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The ICC is having a facelift.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;They seem to be going back to the bone!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n65/IMG_20191106_125613374.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Lots of building materials stashed behind hordings beside the museum.&quot; /&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst we were here, Tony also took the opportunity to try and book Liberty Belle into a boatyard to have her propeller fixed. He chose a convenient boatyard and contacted the number. After some confusing phone calls where he was sent around from one phone number to another until he came full circle, he tried another boatyard. Here he had more success. Now that we had a date we could plan our next few weeks of travel. We decided we had enough time to explore the Birmingham Canals before heading for the Coventry area for Liberty Belle's dry-dock booking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having had the call to say our inverter was ready for collection, Tony went by train to fetch it. It had been the switch that was broken. The nice engineer said there was no charge, so Tony handed him some beer money and both were happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once it was back in position and working, we were off. There is a very complicated network of canals around Birmingham and Tony had planned a route that would enable us to travel along most of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It felt good to be on the move again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Where Next?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are still chugging around Birmingham and will be heading to the boatyard in time for Liberty Belle's dry-dock 'appointment'.
We had hoped to have time to explore the Ashby Canal on the way but that will now have to wait until next year....&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rachel Glombek</name></author><category term="LibertyBelle" /><summary type="html">Birmingham 4th - 13th November 2019</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Good Ol’ Brummagem</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/libertybellenewsletter/libertybelle/2019/11/14/good-ol-brummagem.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Good Ol' Brummagem" /><published>2019-11-14T16:21:00+00:00</published><updated>2019-11-14T16:21:00+00:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/libertybellenewsletter/libertybelle/2019/11/14/good-ol-brummagem</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/libertybellenewsletter/libertybelle/2019/11/14/good-ol-brummagem.html">&lt;h2&gt;From Nantwich to Birmingham&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;14th - 23rd October 2019&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Our route&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n64/P1270884.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A partially obscured sign reading 'Hack Green Secret Nuclear Bunker'&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Shhh...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Luckily the weeds have grown over this sign, otherwise everyone would know!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We left Nantwich on a misty autumn morning with lots of locks ahead of us. The canal was busy and so there was a lot of waiting around for Liberty Belle but it is always nice to chat at the locks and help each other through. It had been a long and tiring day and the sky began to look threatening before we arrived at our planned mooring. We tied up for the night before the last two locks on the Audlem flight, just in time for the rain to start!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the locks I had heard rumours of cake so, whilst Tony put the kettle on, I dashed up to the top of the flight to investigate. Sure enough I found a covered stall on a garden wall with various cakes, bagged up in pairs, a price list and an honesty box. What a wonderful idea. I chose lemon drizzle...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the way back I helped a single-handed boater through the last lock and passed on the information about cake. He was suitably excited about the news!  Then I took my treasure indoors before I got too wet!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We spent the evening in the Shroppie Fly pub, just a few locks down from our mooring and treated ourselves to a delicious meal. Apart from some lads playing pool in the other bar, we were the only customers. Considering the quality of the food, this seemed a real shame, but I suppose it was a school night...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;An unusual building at one of the Audlem locks.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Off the next day to Market Drayton, with plenty of locks to do again. We eagerly checked the cake stall as we passed by but were disappointed to find it empty. As we reached a bend in the canal we looked over our shoulders just in time to see an elderly gentleman carrying cake boxes to the stall. Noooooo, too late!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The canal was busy but the boats were well choreographed, one up, one down, one up, one down... Ideal!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We made it to Market Drayton in no time and looked for somewhere to tie up. We pulled over at some mooring rings and read the notice. Mooring was allowed on this stretch of the canal on market day and the day before, Wednesdays and Tuesdays....  We discussed this for an embarrassingly long time but came to the conclusion that it was Tuesday and so we tied up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n64/P1270951.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A colourful 'Welcome to Market Drayton' sign with pictures of buildings from the town, a kingfisher and a perch fish.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;A really delightful sign welcoming us.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n64/P1270952.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A Canal and River Trust sign reading 'Welcome to Market Drayton. Overnight mooring only Except for Tuesday &amp;amp; Wednesday (pre-market and market days), when daytime mooring is allowed.'&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;So, what day is it?&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n64/P1270955.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Liberty Belle mooring in daylight on a Tuesday!&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Our Tuesday mooring...!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to our early arrival at Market Drayton and the good weather that afternoon, we managed to service Liberty Belle's engine. Not only that, but the engine still seemed to work afterwards! We were pleased with ourselves until we discovered that the battery inverter, which provides 240V electricity for the TV and my hairdryer, no longer worked.  What on earth could we have done?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After much discussion and checking Tony managed to convince me that it must be a coincidence...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tony with a beard and me without a hairdryer, personal grooming is at an all-time low.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;On the way to find a supermarket in Market Drayton we discovered this...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;...and felt we should investigate.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;It was a good decision.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n64/IMG-20191015-WA0002.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A beermat describing the history of Joule's Ales&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;So really, it was an educational visit.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following morning we set off in the autumn sunshine. We were travelling through a tunnel of trees, with insects busy in the shafts of sunlight and leaves falling all around us, catching the light as they tumbled. Beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then the hard work began, with some difficult locks. The advice for operating the Tyrley Flight is to keep the boat in the previous lock whilst setting the next, because of the strong sidewash across the front of each one. This way the boat can be driven at top speed towards the source of the sidewash which will then turn the bow towards the open lock gates....(If the boat is left to drift in the pound it will be too difficult to approach the next lock at the right angle.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The crew member thus needs to walk ahead, set the lock, open the gates, walk back to the previous lock, shut the gate, back to the current lock, shut the gate.....etc&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The locks were far enough apart to make this a slow, laborious process.
We also had a boat just in front of us, which meant we needed to empty each lock again before we could use it. The chap in front took pity on us and, when he could, after leaving the lock, he would wind up a paddle to start to drain it for us. This made life a lot easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Crikey!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Now we need to look out for rockfalls...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n64/P1280021.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A very tall bridge over the canal.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Being in a deep cut means high bridges&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;...one with a short telegraph pole standing in the middle.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The Shropshire Canal has gates that can be used to cut off sections for repair.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n64/P1280052.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A tall rectangular brick building with a sloping roofed extension towards the canal providing shelter for loading and unloading boats.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;A small wharf previously belonging to Cadbury.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n64/P1280095.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A tunnel through the red sandstone. SOme stone has collapsed at the sides.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The local rock obviously doesn't cut easily giving this tunnel entrance an interesting shape.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later in the day the battery warning light came on so we had to pull over and have a look. It seems, in our attempt to inspect and tighten the alternator belt we had, in fact, managed to loosen it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following morning,Tony replaced the alternator belt with one of his spares and all was well. (We have plenty of spares of everything for the engine because it is so difficult to buy them at a reasonable price when travelling around).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We then had a short journey into Wheaton Aston where we knew that one of the locks was being repaired and wasn't due to open until that afternoon. When we investigated, the workmen were obviously still busy and told us that it may take longer than forecast, possibly until the following afternoon, so we prepared to stay there for a day or maybe more...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A hire boat, that we had seen several times over the past couple of days, moored up behind us and were surprised to learn that the lock was closed for repair. We were shocked that the hire firm hadn't warned them, as it had been planned for some time. They were quite upbeat about it though and one of the women was actually pleased as it would give her a chance to have her hair done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst we waited we visited the village but there was very little to see. We checked the vegetable options in both shops and found we had a choice of cauliflower or.... cauliflower. We also looked for a hairdresser for our new friend but there wasn't one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the way back to the canal we met our boating neighbours and informed them that the village had just a Co-op and a Spar. The woman's eyes lit up! A Spa! Wonderful! Her dreams had come true.... We were a bit baffled then realised the mistake. No, no. A 'So-near-so-Spar', not a health spa. What a disappointment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it turned out the lock opened that evening but we stayed overnight and left first thing the following morning.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were both looking forward to being back in Brumm but first we had to get through the 21 locks at Wolverhampton. We thought these might be rather industrial and run down but were pleasantly surprised. They we all very neat, well kept and easy to operate. About half way up the set of locks we came across a busy work party hoeing, weeding, sweeping and rubbish picking. Wow! This was Wolverhampton's secret - a well supported community payback scheme!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most canals approaching cities are rather grim but around Birmingham there are many beautiful sections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Lock pride, that's what we like to see.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n64/IMG-20191019-WA0002.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Liberty Belle moored just over the fence from the museum.&quot; /&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Years of ropes cutting into the stone as the horses pulled their boats out of the lock.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We eventually arrived in Birmingham and found a 14 day mooring next to some residential boats and near the Canal &amp;amp; River Trust offices. We always feel safe in good ol' Brummagem, but this mooring felt especially so. We decided that we no longer needed to get to Leamington Spa before going back to the house as we were already in the ideal place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After getting a few jobs done and meeting up with Julia for a delightful lunch, we were fortunate enough to get a lift all the way back to the house where the garden was awaiting our attention...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Where Next?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tony has booked Liberty Belle into a boatyard near Coventry for the first week in December to have her propeller repaired. We will be heading back to the house whilst she is in the dry dock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime we are exploring the canals around Birmingham.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rachel Glombek</name></author><category term="LibertyBelle" /><summary type="html">From Nantwich to Birmingham 14th - 23rd October 2019</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Liberty Belle Visits Her Home Town</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/libertybellenewsletter/libertybelle/2019/11/07/liberty-belle-visits-her-home-town.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Liberty Belle Visits Her Home Town" /><published>2019-11-07T16:58:00+00:00</published><updated>2019-11-07T16:58:00+00:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/libertybellenewsletter/libertybelle/2019/11/07/liberty-belle-visits-her-home-town</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/libertybellenewsletter/libertybelle/2019/11/07/liberty-belle-visits-her-home-town.html">&lt;h2&gt;From Chester to Nantwich&lt;/h2&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Pretty Shropshire.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As September came to an end we began to see hips and haws in the hedgerows with crab apples and damsons in the trees above.
The leaves began to fall, the temperature began to drop and most days came with rain showers. We kept ourselves going with mugs of coffee and cocoa on the move.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tony decided to grow his beard to help keep him warm over winter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We still occasionally spotted sprigs of meadow sweet or a butterfly to remind us of the summer just gone.
(We were surprised to see some very young ducklings in the first week of October; I don't hold out much hope of them maturing in time for winter.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dodging the rain as much as possible we left Chester and headed for Wales. (Probably not the best place to go if you are trying to avoid the wet weather.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turning onto the Llangollen Canal we immediately entered the first of the Hurleston Locks which is rather narrow and needs careful handling, so it is manned by lock keepers. Liberty Belle was a tight fit, but we made it through without incident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a reservoir here at the bottom of the Hurleston Locks which is filled from the Llangollen canal. The water rushes past the locks through the overflows on its way to the reservoir, creating quite a strong current in front of the bottom gates. This makes the approach to the locks difficult. These locks were also hard to operate, so we both had a tiring day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once we had moored up we realised our phone signals were poor so we decided to go to the local pub to use their WiFi and get a bit more newsletter done. When we tried to access the WiFi we were informed that the local BT box had been involved in a traffic accident and so there was no WiFi to be had. We were advised to have a conversation...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n63/P1270373.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Liberty Belle approaching the entrance to a bridge over the Llangollen Canal.&quot; /&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;..and into the tight lock.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Another flight of locks! Grindley Brook&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the day we approached Ellesmere there were no locks to do but plenty of swing bridges which was just as well as I needed something to do to keep me warm. The canal was pretty enough but not very interesting except for the kingfishers and herons. We occasionally had a gap in the hedge through which we would see either a field of corn or cows. Ellesmere itself is a pleasant little place with cafes, useful shops and canal-side art.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n63/P1270427.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Rachel winding a lift bridge open as Liberty Belle approaches and an oncomimg boat waits by the towpath.&quot; /&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Instead of the usual black &amp;amp; white, this lift bridge was camouflaged.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Maybe the local smugglers hope we will crash into it in the fog so they can lay claim to our cargo!?!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;... or two..&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n63/DSCN3299.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Tony sitting in a stone, boat shaped shelter.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;...some more useful than others.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Leaving the little Ellesmere arm and heading for Llangollen.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Ellesmere the views became much more interesting and, in response, so did the canal. The complicated landscape required tunnels, embankments, locks, aqueducts and  viaducts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First we negotiated the Chirk tunnels. Neither of these is very long, as tunnels go, but they took us ages! We were going against the flow of water (to the reservoir) and, because Liberty Belle was a fairly tight fit, she had difficulty displacing the water. It seemed to take forever!. Thankfully there wasn't a queue of boats waiting to come through...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;A railway via-duck in the distance.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually we reached the famous Pontcysyllte Aqueduct. Tony went onto the tow path to take some photographs and I drove. Although I have been across it several times (in hire boats), I suddenly felt scared. I am not sure why but I seemed to talk myself into it somehow. I could feel my heart being squeezed. I knew logically that I was safe, but it was quite a weird sensation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Immediately after the aqueduct is a very tight turn under a bridge, so I handed over the tiller to the expert and corrected my breathing!
Before reaching Llangollen there are a couple of stretches of the canal which are not wide enough for boats to pass each other, so I went ahead on foot to make sure these sections were free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n63/P1270566.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Liberty Belle crossing the Pontcysyllte Aqueduct&quot; /&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;My view!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Gulp...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n63/P1270605.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Rachel standing in frony of one of the stone bridges on the way to Lllangollen.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Terra firma.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We made it to the moorings without incident and tied up in the best position; in the sunshine, as near to the town as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the background we could hear dogs barking and thought we must be moored near a boarding kennels...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Off we went to pay for 2 nights' mooring and discovered that the electric hook-up was included in the price! Perfect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suddenly dogs started to appear on the wooded slope on the opposite side of the canal. One jumped into the water, then another. They both tried to scrabble back onto the bank but the concrete side was too steep. I and another boater dashed over trying to encourage the dogs to the towpath side. One responded and I tried to grab it but it had no collar so I couldn't get a hold. The two dogs were now frantic, barking and scrabbling against the concrete sides. Other dogs jumped in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A man appeared on the wooded bank, and we assumed the dogs must be his. Tony moved Liberty Belle across the canal to pick him up and transport him to the tow path.  Once he was on the same side as us, all the rest of the dogs (there must have been a dozen all together) jumped into the canal trying to swim to him. Flippin' 'eck. More people tried to help but none of the dogs had collars... The only thing left to do was to get into the canal and help each dog out in turn. The owner agreed that it would probably come to that.... None of us volunteers felt prepared to get in water so we left him to get his own tweed suit wet. I assume he did just that. I don't suppose he looked quite so dapper in his country gentleman's outfit by the time he got home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it turned out that we were not opposite boarding kennels after all and were in a very quiet, as well as pretty and convenient mooring. After a walk to the end of the canal at Horseshoe Falls, out came the vacuum cleaner, the electric heater and our new electric kettle and we attempted to get our money's worth!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;A passing steam train.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making good use of our two day mooring and the beautiful weather, we went for a walk to the castle ruins overlooking the town. Castell Dinas Bran, or Crow Castle, is a Medieval castle built on the site of an Iron Age hillfort. The walk was delightful and views were spectacular.
We decided to walk back via the Pontcysyllte Aqueduct and along the canal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the time we got to the canal, the weather had changed. It was too wet and windy to enjoy a walk over the aqueduct so we sheltered as well as we could and had a little picnic outside the visitors' centre. We were just in time to see a very small day-hire boat trying to negotiate the tight turn under the bridge heading for the aqueduct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The little boat had two men at the back and several passengers, most of them children. The helmsman was going at full speed and didn't seem to know how to steer. He smacked into the side of the canal, reversed without looking behind him, then went full speed forwards again, with the inevitable smack into the side. The children on the boat were screaming as they were thrown about. One of them was wearing another's hot chocolate drink all over the back of her coat. The men at the helm showed no concern whatsoever as they bashed and crashed their way about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nutters!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We left before we had to witness the crossing of the aqueduct...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We stopped off at a pub on the way back, grateful for some respite from the rain.
On our return we were pleased to see that the Nutters' hire boat wasn't embedded in the side of Liberty Belle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were moored in the last space before the hire company's moorings with a narrow bridge between. There was no sign of any damage, but I was glad I hadn't been there to witness them passing by!&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After spending our couple of days exploring the area around Llangollen, we took Liberty Belle back the way we came. Back over the aqueduct (Tony at the helm), through Chirk tunnels (this time we were travelling with the flow, which made it easy).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n63/P1270675.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Tony driving Liberty Belle back across Chirck Aqueduct.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Back the way we came....&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n63/P1270685.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A blue sign reading 'Welcome to England'.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;...back into England&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time we had booked passage through the locks onto the Montgomery Arm and planned to explore the Prees Branch too on our way back to the Shropshire Union.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Montgomery Arm is being restored and is only navigable for the first 7 miles. The number of visitor boats allowed on the arm at any one time is limited to 12 and passage through the locks at the top of the arm has to be booked in advance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We moored at the top of the Montgomery Canal ready to go down the set of locks as soon as they opened at midday. As it happened, they were ready early and waved us in at 11:30.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n63/P1270762.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A cast iron signpost pointing to Llangollen, Hurleston and Mongomery.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Turning into the Montgomery Canal&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n63/P1270706.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A cast iron signpost reading 'Newtown 35 Miles, Welsh Frankton 0 Miles, Montgomery Canal'.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Are we back in Wales?&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n63/P1270707cropped2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A Canal and River Trust chalkboard reading 'Welcome to Frankton! Boats booked for passgae today. Down, Liberty Belle ....'&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;They are expecting us.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n63/P1270714.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Rachel standing behind a stone wall at the edge of the canal. The wall has a small gap spanned by a cast iron arch.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;An iron rail over a gap in the wall, to stop the horse's rope getting caught.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once through the locks the canal was uneventful. It was shallow, which made us slow, and had high hedges on both sides so there was not much to see. As we got nearer to the end of the navigable section of the canal, we came across a winding hole and decided to take the opportunity to turn, just in case the canal got any more difficult to navigate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was hard work, with me on the tiller revving and reversing and Tony with the barge pole shoving and heaving. With much churning of mud and weed we finally managed to turn and moored at the first opportunity. We then walked the final stretch of canal into town only to find it was the best bit! Oh well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walking back to Liberty Belle we noticed that a boat was straddling the canal. It was attached to the bank opposite the tow path with it's bow rope. It's stern rope had frayed right through allowing the boat to float freely across the canal. That was going to be tricky for the next boat to come along. Now we were glad that we hadn't brought Liberty Belle up this far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following morning we headed back to the start of the canal arm to arrive at the locks just as they opened at 12 and then turned back onto the main branch to Ellesmere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following day we took a diversion down the short Prees Arm, (which never did reach as far as Prees) to see the skew lift bridge highlighted in our guides. It was indeed skew although it wasn't clear why, as it didn't really line up with the track on either side. We bought a bottle of gas in the marina at the end of the arm, reversed out, turned and followed the arm back onto the main canal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We thought the Prees Branch was prettier than the Montgomery but at first we weren't sure why. We decided that, although both canals were lined with hedges, the ones on the Prees branch were set a little bit further back from the canal itself and were interspersed with various trees, so the heights, textures and colours made it more interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alongside the canal here is a nature reserve, consisting of peat bogs and lakes. Originally it was a battle to keep the canal sides from collapsing and joining the lake but in more recent years, steel piling has been used to create a firm edge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We continued on to Whitchurch, finally arriving in the dark. It was quite busy on the main canal so there was plenty of help at the locks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n63/P1270827.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Liberty Belle in a lock with several streams of water eminating from holes in the brick lock wall.&quot; /&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The pretty church (locked) is right on the edge of a mere&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n63/P1270836.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Passing back through the narrowest lock under the watchfull eyes of the Canal and iver Trust staff.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The vigilant lock keepers at Hurleston Locks&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After squeezing back through the Hurleston locks under the watchful gaze of the lock keepers, we turned back onto the Shropshire Union Canal, heading this time for Nantwich. We arrived and found a mooring by the Nantwich Aqueduct, Liberty Belle's home 'ground'.
(We were a little bit concerned that the original owners would see her and demand to know what on earth we had done to their boat. Luckily we got away with it!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n63/P1270855.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A life-sized draft horse, leaning to take the strain, constructed from large old timbers, probably lock gates.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Horses are often the subject of canal-side art.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Isn't he something?&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n63/P1270850.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A narrow boat called 'Liberty'&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Where Next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This newsletter has been a long time coming, I know!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are currently in Birmingham waiting for our battery inverter to be fixed. We will then spend some time exploring the network of canals around the city before heading towards Milton Keynes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully we will be able to buy some coal on the way - it's getting a bit nippy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our plans are not very detailed yet as we need to book Liberty Belle in at a boatyard (somewhere) to have her propeller fixed and her bottom painted...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, watch this space.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rachel Glombek</name></author><category term="LibertyBelle" /><summary type="html">From Chester to Nantwich 30th September - 13th October 2019</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Wall-to-Wall Chester</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/libertybellenewsletter/libertybelle/2019/10/19/wall-to-wall-chester.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Wall-to-Wall Chester" /><published>2019-10-19T22:01:00+01:00</published><updated>2019-10-19T22:01:00+01:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/libertybellenewsletter/libertybelle/2019/10/19/wall-to-wall-chester</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/libertybellenewsletter/libertybelle/2019/10/19/wall-to-wall-chester.html">&lt;h2&gt;Chester and Ellesemere Port&lt;/h2&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Our route&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n62/DSCN3257.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Liberty Belle dwarfed beneath about a ten storey brick built mill.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Liberty Belle moored outside the former steam driven flour mill.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wow! Chester! Where do you begin? The Cathedral, Roman Amphitheatre, Castle, Roodee (?), city walls....?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The obvious thing to do first is to walk the city walls but the weather wasn't very nice when we arrived so we put that off until the following day when it was due to be fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we started by exploring the shops. But these are not just shops, they are the fascinating and decorative Medieval Rows. These buildings have shops a step or two below street level, then a second level of shops above these with steps up to them and a walkway along the front. This walkway is roofed by the storey above which juts out and is supported on pillars. These buildings stretch along both sides of four streets in the centre of Chester. Amazing! What more could you want on a rainy day?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sadly, as with most town centres at the moment, rather a lot of the shops were empty. They need to take a leaf out of Wigan's book...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n62/DSCN3221.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A view down one of Chester's streets of timber framed buildings from one of the gates in the walls.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Chester&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n62/DSCN3131.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;One of the timber frames shops in the Rows with a small stone stairway appended to the outside.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt; A set of steps up to the second storey in the Rows.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n62/DSCN3255.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;An elaborately decorated building with the words 'To God My King and My Country' carved on a lintel and statue of a king.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;An elaborate shop front. &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n62/DSCN3129.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Tony about to bump his head on one of the low beams in the upper storey of the Rows.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The Rows were clearly built with shorter people in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n62/DSCN3198.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Mary and Rachel beside a bronze scupture of a life-sized baby elephant.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Can we keep him, Tony?&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Can we?&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Pleeease?&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n62/P1270348.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;What appears to be a tall brick-built chimney but was in fact used for lead shot manufacture.&quot; /&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Molten lead, dripped from the top, forms a sphere on it's way down to the cooling water at the base.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Genius!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next was Chester's Cathedral. We joined a guided tour which was absolutely fascinating. The Cathedral was wonderful to look at but so much more wonderful when we had some of it explained. Here are just a few of the very many photos we took...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n62/DSCN3212.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Mary and Tony beside the railing of the Cathedral grounds.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n62/DSCN3214.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A tall, square, modern stone and tiled tower&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The Cathedral's bell tower, built when the main tower was declared no longer strong enough to bear the bells.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n62/DSCN3192.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Inside the cathedral - a Romanesque arch and a gothic arch with a series of small Romanesque arches above.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The little arches part way up the wall mark the original height of this bit of the cathedral and are held up by recycled Roman pillars.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n62/DSCN3195.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Tall narrow Gothic style windows with extra, vertical, fluted pillars on the inside which are braced to the window mullions.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Early Gothic windows.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The earliest.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;SO early that they weren't convinced they would be strong enough so they have strengthening pillars against the mullions.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n62/DSCN3159.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A Gothic style arch with a smaller scalloped arch beneath.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;A fancy arch.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n62/DSCN3182.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A picture of the Madonna and Child painted on a sheet of fabric made from insect cocoon fabric. It is illuminated by a light behind.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;A painting on a cobweb!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;(Well, some sort of cocoon fabric...)&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cathedral began as the abbey church of a Benedictine monastery. The quire stalls are elaborately carved with a misericord seat, each with a separate canopy above, for each of the 48 monks of the monastery. Apparently the subject of the carvings on the seats were not allowed to be taken from the Bible because it would have been disrespectful to sit on them, so mythical characters were used. Many carpenters were involved and each design had to be approved by the monastery before they were made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n62/DSCN3174.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A carved wooden elephant whose body resembles a horse, including hooves and a more realistic elephant head.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;...or just nodding off!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n62/DSCN3155.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Several panels of mosaic on the cathedral wall depicting various religious scenes.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The Bishop's Courtroom.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That evening, Tony and I decided to go back to the Cathedral for Evensong. The atmosphere in a place of worship during a service adds another dimension to the building and it is just nice to appreciate the space when it is being used in the way it was intended. In a village church it can feel a bit intrusive but in a Cathedral it seems more appropriate. We enjoyed the experience very much, especially as we were directed to sit in the monks' seats behind the choir. The sad thing was that the congregation was outnumbered by those taking the service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following day we set off along Chester's City Walls. Begun by the Romans, updated in Medieval times and repaired regularly ever since, the two mile walk gives the perfect vantage point from which to view the City.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The signs on the front mark the boundary between two different parishes.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abutting the walls is Chester's Roodee Race Track. This area was a Roman port which became filled in with silt. Then it was used as a sports ground but in 1533 the football games became so violent that they were banned. They were replaced by horse racing by the consent of the Mayor of the time, Henry Gee, of gee-gee fame! Yes, it's true!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Despite the evidence I remain convinced that they race horses here, not rhinos.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On our way to Chester we had met a man who recommended the Telford's Warehouse pub. Our walk along the walls just happened to take us there at around lunch time, so we popped in and Mary treated us. Mmmm. The food was very good indeed, not to mention the beer. Thanks Mary!

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n62/P1270344.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The canalside Telford Warehouse consisting of a large rectangular building with a smaller gabled building attached. The smaller building has archways and an entrance over the water which allow a boat to move under the building for loading and unloading.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;An historic wharf building, now a pub.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n62/IMG-20190925-WA0005.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Mary behind a plate of yorkshire pudding filled with mashed potato and topped with three sausages.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Tony's dinner was big but not as massive as it looks in this photo!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As if all this wasn't enough, we popped into the Grosvenor museum where lots of Roman artifacts are displayed and, in the adjoining Number 20 Castle Street, there is a series of nine period rooms dating from 1680 to 1925.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having spent two weeks travelling on Liberty Belle, Mary took the train home from Chester. We kept her company on her first train, to Crewe. We wondered what Crewe would have to offer...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second breakfast, it turned out, in the form of Staffordshire Oat Cakes filled with a full English! This was a first for us but certainly not a last.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n62/IMG-20190926-WA0000.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Rachel inspecting the contents of a Staffordshire oatcake 'sandwich'&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Breakfast, the Staffordshire way!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two of us arrived back in Chester and sheltered from the rain in Chester's first Cathedral, St Johns. which was well worth a visit. We then had a closer look at the Roman amphitheatre and garden before returning to Liberty Belle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n62/DSCN3265.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Romanesque arches with a row of smaller arches above.&quot; /&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;A bit of shopping.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;New shoes?&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Oh yes!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mary must have known that the weather was about to take a real turn for the worse...my goodness we had a lot of rain over the next several days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We left Chester behind for a couple of days whilst we went to Ellesmere Port, where they have a Museum dedicated to canals, barges and narrow boats. We didn't know what to expect but it turned out to be fascinating. We spent a whole day there, dodging in and out of the buildings to avoid the heavy showers. There was technical information about canals, locks, bridges and boats as well as social history concerning navvies, boat builders, boaters and all the other people needed at the wharves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n62/DSCN3289.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A cast iron sign reading 'Ellesmere Port 0 Miles, Autherley Junction 66 1/2 Miles, Chester 9 Miles&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;0 Miles?&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;I guess we must be here then.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n62/IMG_20190928_124616.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Tony using an interactive display simulating the boat rocking required to break the ice on the canal.&quot; /&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;It must have been exhausting!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We spent the night moored in Ellesmere Port then made our way back to Chester. It was pouring with rain (again), so where better to sit it out than Telford's Warehouse...?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Where Next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are popping back to the house next week to get some jobs done...
Once we are re-united with Liberty Belle we will probably stay in the Midlands until we head for the Milton Keynes area for the winter.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rachel Glombek</name></author><category term="LibertyBelle" /><summary type="html">Chester and Ellesemere Port 23rd - 29th October 2019</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Mary’s Grand Tour</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/libertybellenewsletter/libertybelle/2019/10/17/marys-grand-tour.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Mary's Grand Tour" /><published>2019-10-17T17:36:00+01:00</published><updated>2019-10-17T17:36:00+01:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/libertybellenewsletter/libertybelle/2019/10/17/marys-grand-tour</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/libertybellenewsletter/libertybelle/2019/10/17/marys-grand-tour.html">&lt;h2&gt;From Liverpool to Chester&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;11th - 23rd September 2019&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/maps/n61map.png&quot; alt=&quot;Our route&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n61/P1270064.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Mary and Rachel taking tea while seated on the towpath beside Liberty Belle&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Enjoying the September sunshine.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we were in Liverpool! This compact city snuggles right up to the docks, so we were ideally positioned for exploring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, before we could do any sightseeing, we had a few jobs to do in preparation for Mary's visit. Mainly laundry, shopping and housework (or boatwork).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our Salthouse Dock mooring we had free electric hook-up! So exciting!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We used Liberty Belle's vacuum cleaner for the first time to prepare the boat for our honoured guest and, because the overnight temperatures were beginning to feel rather autumnal, Tony bought an electric heater for the princely sum of £6, which worked a treat!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Laundry? There's an app for that!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a slightly complicated journey by train, Mary finally arrived in Liverpool to meet us. The weather was on our side so we spent the next couple of days exploring the city on foot and by open-top bus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We like Liverpool. It is a friendly, interesting and clean city which is busy and bustling without being cramped and has fascinating buildings, both ancient and modern, sitting harmoniously side by side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n61/DSCN2886.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A sculpture of a rearing horse. Its tail appears to be unravelling into a pile of rope on the ground.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;By standing on it's tail, the man is unravelling the horse into a pile of rope.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n61/DSCN2920.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Tony and Rachel stood in front of the larger than life-sized Beatles statue.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Here they come, walking down the street..!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Oh no, hang on, that's another lot.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We visited Liverpool's Catholic Cathedral which is truly a place of two contrasting halves! Its foundations were built to a traditional, vaulted design, but the construction was interrupted by war. By the time the building resumed they had a very different design, so above ground it is shockingly modern...!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the outside the Cathedral appears to promise a light, airy and colourful inside space but I was personally disappointed, finding it remarkably gloomy. I couldn't help comparing it to the Coventry Cathedral which I much prefer. However, the story of it's construction was fascinating and well presented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n61/DSCN2889.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;An external view of the cathedral looking like an upside down funnel.&quot; /&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n61/DSCN2899.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A view down a similar vault with interpretation boards.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The space is huge. The original plans for the Cathedral were, to say the least, dramatic.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We popped into Liverpool's Central Library as we were passing by. My goodness, this building is amazing! It is modern and traditional, calm and exciting. Tony and I both thought that we could live here just to have daily access to this place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The children's section is shaped like an amphitheatre, with steps all around, scattered with bean bags and a stage in the middle. When we were there a little girl was performing ballet moves on the stage for her mother's entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hushed Reading Room has beautiful wooden bookcases with steps and walkways to give access to the higher shelves. The lobby, oh my goodness, is modern and wonderful with escalators zig-zagging into the sky above your head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n61/DSCN2932.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The honey oak library shelves radiate out in the large circular room. The shelves extend to a second floor.&quot; /&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Strawberry Fields forever!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two days wasn't long enough to do justice to the lovely Liverpool, but we had other plans...

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n61/DSCN2945.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Looking back towards Liverpool between the modern buildings around the docks.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Goodbye Liverpool.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n61/DSCN2953.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Liberty Belle moving slowly alongside another boat between two locks on the way out of Liverpool.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Sharing the locks out of Liverpool in the drizzle.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were looking forward to Chester but that was nearly 2 weeks away. In the meantime we had the excitement of tunnels and swing bridges, the surprisingly lovely Wigan, the free bits of the Dunham Massey Hall and the amazing Anderton Boat Lift.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In between these wonders Mum and I walked the towpath for exercise for a while each day and then sat in the bow watching for kingfishers and other wildlife. We even saw a turtle basking in the sunshine on a log.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n61/DSCN2965.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The windmill art gallery at Parbold with a crenellated top and no domed roof.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;We stopped off in Par-boiled, but the Windmill Gallery was closed. Typical.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n61/P1260965.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A partly open, rusty swing bridge with bushes growing on it.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;A swing bridge returning to nature...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We gingerly moored up in Wigan to have a look around. We set off to find the town and weren't quite sure of the route. We stopped two young lads and asked them. They were friendly and helpful despite being a little confused as they couldn't think what we could possibly see there!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually, we were pleasantly surprised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new shopping arcades in the town have been tastefully built to blend in with the old buildings. The library/museum was welcoming and interesting; we certainly couldn't fault the enthusiasm of the staff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The town is trying very hard to envelop the residents in arts projects. The people of Wigan have collaborated to create a manifesto entitled 'The Fire Within' which is an attempt to boost local culture, bring life back to the town centre and encourage local talent. Some empty shops are being used as galleries to display artefacts from the museum's collections as well as projects from local clubs and schools. Other unused units are now performance space for local groups and individuals to show off their talents in front of their family, friends, neighbours and visitors. Poetry recitals, dance, music, theatre all take place in the arcade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result of all these events, a local family have been able to open a successful new cafe in one of the empty spaces, providing refreshments for all the visitors. Go Wigan!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;A slightly more famous visitor to Wigan.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On our way we found a pretty mooring space opposite a lake. This turned out to be the Pennington Flash Country Park, created by subsidence after the collapse of salt mines in the area. These 'flashes' seem to be scattered all over the landscape around here.
Along the canal there are unexpectedly wide sections created the same way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Flashes, or lakes, are now used for local leisure and wildlife. There are well kept footpaths and seating areas around the park and plenty of waterfowl to watch. According to the two local men we met on a walk around the lake, there is also a well used hide nearby where birds are fed regularly and provide a good show. We stood with them for a while watching the many cormorants and Great Crested Grebes on the lake. Apparently they are the reason the men no longer fish here, they cannot compete!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n61/P1260998.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Liberty Belle moored on the curve of a canal between two other boats.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Our pretty mooring in the nature reserve.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;A seat with a view.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 1720's the Worsley coal mines used underground water channels to drain the mines and transport the coal on long, narrow boats out into the open. With the rise in demand for coal in Manchester, these 'navigations' were extended and the resulting Bridgewater Canal was opened in 1761. It was the first canal which did not follow the course of an existing river and was fed by the drainage water from the mines. This is where it all began!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is still privately owned and has its own solution to keeping the canal clear of rubbish, a boat called the Waterwomble, which patrols the canal, lifting out anything undesirable as it goes for either recycling or disposal. We asked in passing where the nearest rubbish collection point was and they told us to just sling our rubbish bag on-board, which we did! What service!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n61/DSCN2975.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A wooden carving of two embracing hands with the words '1800 Bridgewater' carved on one and '1820 Leeds and Liverpool' on the other.&quot; /&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The Waterwomble boat.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Bridgewater canal has no locks because it follows the contours of the land which made the life of Liberty Belle's crew rather easy. It has other distinctive features including regular gates set into the canal sides, presumably used to isolate sections of the canal for drainage and repair. Also, at each bridge there is a crane ready to slide wooden boards across the canal for the same purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n61/P1270012.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;An old disused lock-type wooden gate nestles under the edge of the canal under a set of steel barriers which replace it. These can be craned into the slots either side of the canal to isolate a section of the canal. &quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most exciting section of the Bridgewater Canal is the Barton Swing Aquaduct which has carried it over the Manchester Ship Canal since 1894. It swivels in the middle to allow ships to pass below. How amazing is that?&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our travels took us to Dunham Massey Hall, a National Trust property adjacent to the canal. How exciting! We love to explore historic houses!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sadly it was closed on the day of our visit. Typical. However, as it was a lovely day and we were so close, we decided to go and be nosey anyway. To our delight we discovered more than enough to keep us interested. There was the old watermill, the stables, the deer park and even ice-cream!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Some of the stables were later converted to garages. This was the estate's car wash!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The pie-chart is a clock-face, showing us the green cheese of opportunity for boats to enter the tunnel from this end. We'll just wait then, have our tea or something....&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n61/P1270079.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Liberty Belle freed to navigate the tunnel.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;We're in!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On our journey to Chester we were due to pass by the Anderton Boat Lift. This wonderful machine carries boats vertically between the canal and the River Weaver, 50 feet below. The alternative would have been a series of locks but the water loss involved when emptying the locks from the canal down to the river would not have been sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had no reason to be on the river but we couldn't resist a ride! Tony booked us a trip down and then back up again in the same morning.
We were sooo lucky with the weather. The whole process took ages and I wouldn't recommend it as part of a commute to work but as a ride it was wonderful!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n61/P1270204.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The huge cast iron boat lift protrudes from the canal. The duct connecting it to the canal disappears towards the canal.&quot; /&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We finally arrived in Chester. Despite the rain, the town still looked promising, so we decided to stay for a couple of days in the hope that the weather would change and we would have the chance to explore....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Chester! 
(It's a water tower...)&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Where Next?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am sorry that my newsletters are taking soooo long to compile, not only have we been busy travelling, we have been having some network and data problems on the way. Excuses, excuses!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are now on our way South, heading for Birmingham and planning to pop back to the house on or around the 24th October to get a few jobs done and collect some warmer clothes...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond that, we hope to spend the winter around the Milton Keynes area. More details will follow when we have worked them out...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If anyone is interested, the juddering we are experiencing is due to a bent propeller blade. Liberty Belle will need to be lifted out of the water for that to be fixed, so it will be a winter job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;3rd - 11th September 2019&lt;/h2&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Our route&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n60/P1260656.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Liberty Belle cruising under the rainbow!&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Lancashire's changeable weather.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Between us and Liverpool lay Burnley and Wigan, where we had been warned to expect trouble. So we set off early on another grey and windy Lancashire morning, hoping to get through the first of these obstacles before anyone noticed us, and maybe get some shopping on the way...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n60/P1260603.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Liberty Belle, on a cloudy day, about to cross a small stone aquaduct with a plank crane used to dam the canal with planks if maintenance is required.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Grey Lancashire.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n60/P1260591cropped.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Ramps are built ito the canal edges every few miles to enable any horse which falls into the canal to get out again. The ducks now use these ramps.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Horse escape ramp making life easier for ducks.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get our supplies we hoped to pop into Morrisons which, according to Google Maps, was near to the canal and was due to open at 8 am.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We turned a corner and approached the bridge that we planned to moor next to for our shopping trip, steering to the right, towards the towpath.
Just as we did so, the supermarket came into view and we saw that it had its own mooring, but on the opposite side of the canal. As Tony quickly corrected the steering, another boat appeared from under the bridge heading towards us. Tony quickly jerked Liberty Belle over to the right again in order to allow the other boat to pass us on the correct side. All very tricky in the wind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poor Liberty Belle didn't know whether she was coming or going and we consequently got stuck aground. The helmsman on the other boat asked if we needed assistance as he passed by but we declined with thanks...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After getting properly afloat again we needed to reverse, in the wind, back around the corner and try to persuade Liberty Belle's bow to head for the supermarket mooring. After some fancy tiller work and a lot of luck, we tied up outside Morrisons only to be confronted by a locked gate....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;thoughtbubble&quot;&gt;I checked the supermarket opening times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;thoughtbubble&quot;&gt;Yep, it should be open.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;thoughtbubble&quot;&gt;As the gate was at the back of the supermarket, maybe they had forgotten to open it...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;thoughtbubble&quot;&gt;Maybe they never open it...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;thoughtbubble&quot;&gt;I found their phone number and began to ring them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;thoughtbubble&quot;&gt;No answer yet...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;thoughtbubble&quot;&gt;I suddenly had a thought. Maybe the gate can be opened with a boater's Waterways Facilities key or anti-vandal key, (usually used for locks and swing bridges).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I cut the phone call and we tried, with success!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having got through the gate and re-locked it, (the anti-vandal locks can be a fiddle at the best of times) we realised we didn't have a trolley token or a pound coin on us. We couldn't be bothered to fight our way back through the gate again and so limited ourselves to a basket-full of shopping - one very heavy basket! It was enough though and we set off again as soon as we could.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The Heron is our constant companion.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The famous Burnley Straight Mile, a huge embankment built to carry the Leeds &amp;amp; Liverpool canal above Burnley, is thought to be one of the Seven Wonders of the British canal system. It was built to avoid a series of locks which would slow the canal traffic down. At the time it was an innovative solution to cutting down the travel time for the cargo boats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tony agrees that it is a wonder - a wonder we got across it... The water here is so shallow and full of weed and rubbish, we felt we were chewing our way along.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The propeller began to complain so we stopped and Tony cleared a pile of rubbish from around it before setting off again. Shortly afterwards the propeller again complained, this time there was a large sack, amongst other things, wrapped around the workings. Once that was cleared we tried again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n60/DSCN2832cropped.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A large toy car for a child floating in the weedy canal as we look back to a tunnel.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;What is left of a remote control car,&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;remotely controlled straight into the canal.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n60/P1260617.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A 60 foot embankment carries the straight, shallow, weedy canal above Burnley.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Burnley's famous straight mile&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We did, in fact, stop in Burnley, but only for a brief look around. They have an interesting little museum in an old toll house, explaining the town's links with the textile industry and the canal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the men working in the museum explained that Burnley did have a bad reputation amongst boaters but things were improving. Apparently, when Burnley has a festival in the town and lots of boaters want to moor there, he sleeps in the old toll house to keep an eye on the boats! In fact, he had seen someone staring into our boat and had investigated for us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, thanks very much, enough said, off we go!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n60/P1260620.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A two storey stone octagonal canal company toll office next to the canal with iron steps to the first floor.&quot; /&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n60/DSCN2823.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Tony sat at a desk with a blackboard slate in the museum school room.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Tony working hard in the museum's schoolroom.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond this section, all the way to Liverpool, we kept finding other parts of the canal in the same condition. It was frustratingly slow progress. It didn't help that we were doing these double locks on our own and it kept on raining.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suddenly the engine cut out. Tony removed more rubbish from the propeller but this time something appeared to have been damaged.  Poor Liberty Belle now shudders and bumps as we are going along, as if we are driving over cobbles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n60/P1260629.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A view down onto the busy motorway from an aquaduct.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Flying over the motorway on the back of an aqua-duck.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually we arrived at a pound between two very close locks, where there were some boaters' facilities. In my wisdom (?) I decided to allow the next lock to fill up whilst we stopped to fill our water tank. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I nipped over and lifted one of the paddles to let the water drain in before coming back to help Tony manipulate the boat so that we could reach the very awkwardly positioned tap. It became apparent that one of our problems was Liberty Belle was getting grounded. The water in the pound seemed to be very low ... and getting lower...!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh no! Liberty Belle was grounded on one side and tipping...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I dashed back to the lock which was still trying to fill and failing because the water was passing straight through to the other side. The previous users had left a paddle open at the other end... we were rapidly emptying the pound! I dropped all the paddles and Tony dashed back to the previous lock to let water through that one too, down into the pound.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Liberty Belle gradually re-floated, so we stopped the flow of water from the lock above and all was well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All this happened outside the Canal &amp;amp; River Trust office window....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the panic was over and the rain had stopped, one of the volunteers emerged and helped us through the second lock...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n60/DSCN2837.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Some soil covered, derelict, stone domes beside the canal.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Some brick built mounds by the side of the canal.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Old kilns, maybe?&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n60/P1260672.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A blue Canal and River Trust work boat with a small pile of canal debris at the back.&quot; /&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Liberty Belle continued to judder along noisily over the next couple of days  We stopped off in -&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;thoughtbubble&quot;&gt;Cherry Tree (nothing here);&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The mill workers' cottages have the remains of the 'night soil' collection doors at the base of the back walls.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The other small door, higher up, is probably for other household waste collections.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a night at Red Rock Bridge we set off early; too early to say good bye to next door's dogs... We had Wigan and its 25 locks to face, which would be open for boaters at 8:30 having been padlocked overnight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We arrived to find two boats already queuing to go down the locks together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We loitered, waiting for them to go before we slipped into position against the tow path, then I helped the two boats through the first lock. We were pleasantly surprised at the prettiness of the canal here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lock keeper popped over to another moored boat to ascertain whether they intended to go down the locks too. They were, so he paired us up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lock keeper had a young man with him who seemed to know everyone. The woman I was locking with explained that he had been hanging around the locks for quite some time, helping the lock keepers. They had warmed to him and had managed to secure a Canal &amp;amp; River Trust apprenticeship for him. What a nice story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It transpired that our locking companions had been living on their boat for 6 years. Her brother had been living in their house during this time but was now moving out. They couldn't afford to run both a house and a boat so didn't feel they had any option but to sell their boat and move back into the house. She wasn't sure how she was going to cope, living in a home that didn't move about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our locking partners stopped in Wigan after much discussion with the lock keeper on where to moor, but we needed to carry on...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Gangway! We need to get to Wigan locks quickly!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n60/P1260704.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;An elegant, gently arched stone bridge carries the towpath over the entrance to a basin.&quot; /&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;This bridge spans the entrance to a small naturalised basin on the Haigh Hall estate and is Grade II listed&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Lock numbers have changed over the years.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we arrived at the next lock we found a single-handed boater already leaving it. He was happy to wait for us to join him at the following lock, so we were soon partnered again. Single-handed boaters have to work very hard indeed to get through locks, so it is well worth their while to wait quite a long time for another boat to join them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were exhausted by the time we found our mooring at the other side of Wigan, outside a pub in a little village called Crooke. We deserved a pint! It turned out that we were moored in someone's private space but the landlady said they were away, so we were welcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n60/DSCN2860.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Liberty Belle facing the open lock gates with a second boat alongside.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Sharing the locks.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n60/DSCN2863.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Rachel sat on a lock gate waiting for the lock to empty.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Waiting patiently in the sunshine.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Crooke the canal was surprisingly pretty with some views and occasional sunshine (our first in Lancashire). We thought we might stop in Par-boiled (Parbold) which looked delightful with its canal side cafe &amp;amp; old windmill gallery. Unfortunately there was a fishing competition taking place along the tow path, occupying all of the visitor moorings, so we had to keep travelling to Burscough Bridge where we moored for a couple of nights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(We now plan to stop at Par-boiled on our way back with Mary on board.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n60/P1260721.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Liberty Belle moored waiting for the lock to be ready beside a wooden bench, underneath a tall steel motorway bridge.&quot; /&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We finally found Chorley Cakes in a supermarket in Burscough Bridge. Yay!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Old Wharf area here has been nicely restored and has pleasant looking cafes and restaurants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a rainy day in Burscough we woke up the next morning to sunshine and set off for Maghull, as close to Liverpool as we dared to go before nightfall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had moorings booked in the city on Weds 11th and were allowed to arrive sometime between 1 and 4 pm.
Between Maghull and Liverpool is a swing bridge which can only be operated outside rush hour (9:30am until 2 pm, then 6:30 pm until 7:30 am) to cause minimum disruption to road traffic. In order to time our arrival in Liverpool correctly we needed to leave our mooring in Maghull at 
8 am, go through the swing bridge at 9:30 and slide into Liverpool sometime in the afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All went well and we arrived at the swing bridge 5 minutes before we could operate it. Then, despite the shallowness of the canal reducing our speed so much that we thought we would never get there, we reached the top of the Liverpool Dock locks just as they were being opened. Unfortunately two boats were ahead of us so we had to wait, but not for long as there were 3 lock keepers in attendance, helping us all through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The locks were padlocked again behind us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once at the entrance to the docks our route through to our mooring was complicated, weaving from dock to dock through various narrow gaps! We had a map, verbal instructions and a lock keeper meeting us at the last lock... Luckily it all went well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was exciting getting glimpses of the Liver Birds and then suddenly arriving right outside the building! After several bridges and tunnels, one of them under the new museum, we finally passed through Albert Dock into Salthouse Dock where we managed to moor in our allocated space, despite the wind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could hardly believe we were finally here!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Nearly there...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;...then turn next left.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n60/P1260910.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;We head away from the clock tower along a partially infilled dock.&quot; /&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;(or was it the other way around...?)&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Where Next?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This newsletter has been a long time coming!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are now on our way to Wales on the LLangollen Canal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We expect to come back via Nantwich (LIberty Belle's 'home town'), then through Wolverhampton and Birmingham to Leamington Spa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From there we plan to get a train back to the house to get a few jobs done.
