&lt;h2&gt;21st - 27th August 2019&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/maps/n58map.png&quot; alt=&quot;Our route&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Our route&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n58/P1260421.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Liberty Belle cruising the canal with blue sky and hills in the background.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Bank Holiday sunshine and views. &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After restocking the boat stores we left Leeds behind, with a promise from Cathy that she would join us for the Bank Holiday weekend at a little place called Saltaire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a brief section on the RIver Aire, we were back onto a proper canal, surely this should be easy. Our first surprise was the strange mechanisms for opening the locks. There is always something new!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n58/P1260280.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Liberty Belle about to pass under the blue cast iron Leeds Bridge.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Heading for the Leeds Bridge on the River Aire.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Notice the clock on the left...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n58/P1260283.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The clock tower showing two faces with different times.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Before the bridge it was 2:47.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;On the other side it was 12:00.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Magic!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n58/P1260284.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The Leeds coat of arms on Leeds Bridge.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The Leeds Coat of Arms has 3 Owls from the family crest of the city's first Alderman.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Apparently he liked owls - who doesn't?&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n58/P1260269.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A painted mural of a flying heron beside the river.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;An eye-catching mural on the side of the canal.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n58/P1260289.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Rachel winding the paddles up using a horizontal bar attached to the hidden mechanism.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Ok, this is new.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Clockwise to lift??&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Good guess!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n58/P1260290.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A lock gate with a horizontal rack and pinion mechanism attached to a rocking wooden paddle arm.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;A different style of gate paddle too.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;At least I can see the mechanism and how it works.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We travelled along, watching the dragonflies darting and dancing around Liberty Belle, even investigating indoors, briefly. The swallows spent their days swooping overhead and the evenings darting around close to the canal water. The towpaths are beautifully kept and wide enough for walkers, runners and cyclists to co-exist. Consequently they are well used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n58/P1260302.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Approaching a multiple stone arched railway viaduct only partially visible.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;This stone viaduct would be quite impressive if we could see it all...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n58/P1260304.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Many more arches are visible behind a fence.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Just a glimpse over the fence...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n58/P1260264.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A red and cream painted cast iron bridge.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;A pretty iron bridge.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n58/P1260320.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A single arched stone bridge over the canal with a small tower on one side.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;An impressive stone bridge with a little tower.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n58/P1260300.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Many gantries of an electrified railway over a large steel bridge.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Not pretty but impressive.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n58/P1260316.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A boat constructed from odds and ends of wooden items.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Impressive, interesting.... odd!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n58/P1260326.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Liberty Belle approaching a lock flight with a second boat waiting to the side.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Another boat to share the work at Forge Lock flight.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n58/DSCN2648.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A rock in the canal with a lighthouse constructed from a red and white striped, painted traffic cone and LED garden light.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;A tiny, homemade lighthouse with a solar light on top marking this large rock in the canal.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n58/P1260339.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A white painted cast iron 'milestone' with '1/2' written on it.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Looks like a milestone...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Maybe it marks 1/2 mile to the next lock...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n58/P1260336.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A well contructed towpath with a cyclist.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Typical Yorkshire towpath.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n58/P1260353.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A large white 'heron' standing in the canal.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Yorkshire has Egrets as big as herons!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;(A Great White Egret)&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n58/P1260361.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Passing under a black and white painted cast iron bridge with a church tower behind.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Arriving at Saltaire in the sunshine.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a beautiful day when we finally arrived at Saltaire. The village is named after the man who created it, Titus Salt, and the River Aire which runs though it. Titus Salt made his money in the textile industry in Bradford where he owned several mills. Disgusted by the conditions in which his employees lived, he built a new mill on a plot between the railway and canal on the banks of the River Aire which replaced his Bradford Mills. At the same time he built an entire village for his workers; houses, shops, church, school, hospital, almshouses, reading rooms, bath houses, entertainment hall and a recreation park. The mill is now used as a retail centre, an art gallery, business space and housing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The whole village has been very well kept and is delightful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we collected Cathy from the railway station and had a brief visit from Garry and Helen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After lunch we all went for a stroll and an ice-cream for pudding. Tony and I, in our wisdom, decided to have the 'special' - black vanilla. The ice-cream was indeed black. It stained our mouths and the front of my dress! Taste-wise it was vaguely vanilla flavoured and really not worth the bother...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n58/DSCN2664.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The huge stone mill built by Titus Salt with its accompanying tall square chimney.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Salt Mill&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n58/DSCN2659.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Tony in front of a tall statue of Titus Salt on a plinth with an image of a Llama.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Titus Salt, his Llama and Tony&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n58/DSCN2677.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Pretty stone almshouses with arched windows and decorative gables.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Saltaire Almshouses, built to house the elderly and disabled.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n58/DSCN2689.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A scupture featuring a 'cartoon' cat in a bath with its toes inserted into the bath taps.&quot; /&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n58/DSCN2700.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A sculpture of a yellow 'cartoon' dog lounging in a yello dinghy&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;'Dinghy Dog'&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;A local sculptor worked with children to design the 15 sculptures and then made them in his workshop.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n58/IMG-20190906-WA0002.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Rachel eating a tar-like ice cream cone!&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Black vanilla ice-cream.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Cathy as extra crew, we set off and enjoyed a weekend of fabulous weather and beautiful views.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n58/P1260379.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Liberty Belle approaching the five lock staircase at Bingley.&quot; /&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n58/P1260386.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Looking back from inside the staircase.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;... and from inside looking down.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n58/P1260389.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Cathy holding the tiller.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n58/P1260371.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Rachel and Cathy winding the same windlass!&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Sometimes it takes two.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Sunday we decided to treat ourselves to a pub roast dinner. At the appropriate time of day, we moored up and investigated the local pubs. None of them were serving food at all over the Bank Holiday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What? Really?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;'Fraid so...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A friendly couple on the towpath had recommended a pub just a few miles further along the canal so we set off in Liberty Belle to find it, hoping we would get there before they stopped serving...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, we did find it but their kitchen was closed too. What is it with these people? Instead we had a pint and some crisps in the pub, an organ recital in the local church and a cream tea in the village hall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After these delights we set off again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n58/P1260414.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Cathy at the bow of Liberty Belle.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Taking a break from all the work to appreciate the views.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Memorial on the towpath to Polish Airmen who died when their Wellington Bomber crashed on a training exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n58/DSCN2719.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A monument made from stone blocks with a Polish eagle.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Another memorial to the same men situated across a swing bridge in a small garden.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n58/IMG_20190825_150950.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Liberty Belle seen moored from the bridge at Kildwick.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Moored in Kildwick for Sunday lunch.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n58/IMG-20190825-WA0003.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Cathy and Rachel with beer and bags of crisps.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Sunday Lunch arrives.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Three different flavours of potato crisps.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n58/IMG-20190825-WA0006.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Tony and Rachel listening to the church volunteer at the organ.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The wonderful gentleman who gave us a tour of St Andrews church in Kildwick and demonstrated the church organ.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;He played us out with 'Morning has Broken', which took me straight back to infant school.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We found a mooring in Skipton and went in search of some dinner - we felt we deserved something special after the Sunday Lunch nonsense!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After much discussion we settled for the Skipton Balti House. It was definitely the correct decision. After much pondering over the menu we had the most delicious meal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We spent the following day exploring the delights of the lovely Skipton before saying goodbye to Cathy, who had to catch her train back home. We all agreed that it was a town worth visiting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n58/DSCN2738.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Cathy and Rachel eating some very good sausage rolls.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;We found a queue outside&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;J.Stanforth&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;('The Celebrated Pork Pie Establishment')&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;and couldn't resist joining it....&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Where Next?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are due to arrive in Liverpool on 11th September, leaving on the 15th with Mary as extra crew! We plan to visit Chester, Ellesmere Port and Stone during her visit. We have a vague plan of visiting the house sometime in October.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rachel Glombek</name></author><category term="LibertyBelle" /><summary type="html">From Leeds to Skipton 21st - 27th August 2019</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Risking the Red Zone</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/libertybellenewsletter/libertybelle/2019/08/29/risking-the-red-zone.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Risking the Red Zone" /><published>2019-08-29T19:32:00+01:00</published><updated>2019-08-29T19:32:00+01:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/libertybellenewsletter/libertybelle/2019/08/29/risking-the-red-zone</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/libertybellenewsletter/libertybelle/2019/08/29/risking-the-red-zone.html">&lt;h2&gt;From Brighouse to Leeds&lt;/h2&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst travelling along, we had been given notification by the Canal &amp;amp; River Trust that two flood locks ahead of us were closed due to the river water being dangerously high. We decided to stay in Brighouse whilst we waited for the water level to go down. We had a relaxing day, running a few errands and then having a delicious meal at Garry and Helen's cooked for us by the lovely Molly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following morning we were able to move off again, the flood locks having been re-opened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initially we continued with our 'short lock technique' but the locks were getting longer and soon we no longer needed to take special measures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The weather was kind to us and we enjoyed being back in the land of the kingfisher and heron.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;We haven't travelled along the Huddersfield Canal yet...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n57/P1260161.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Liberty Belle passing under a bridge looking out for the turning onto the canal hidden in the river bank.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;On the river looking for the flood lock onto the canal. Somewhere on the right...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n57/P1260165.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The open flood lock to the canal.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;...Here it is!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;It's a good job it is open as there appears to be nowhere to pull over...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout Yorkshire we have been surrounded by Himalayan Balsam creating a hazey pink border to the canal. Pretty though they are, they have taken over from the variety of plants which might otherwise have been there.
Similarly, In the hills around us, the native heather is often fighting against rhododendron bushes. They too can look lovely but are crowding out the natural species of plants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To remind us that summer is coming to a close we had blackberries and bales of hay in the fields around us and the Black Headed Gulls have lost their signature summer plumage. Despite these signs, we still came across the occasional cygnet, duckling and young moorhen. We even saw a pair of moorhens building a nest!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Children of course are still on holiday and we came across groups of boys jumping into the canal from the locks. Not something we or the lock keepers were keen on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n57/P1260189.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A piar of swans and a relatively young cygnet.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;A late brood.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually we reached a lock opening out onto a stretch of river. The river level indicator was just touching the red zone, suggesting that the conditions were again becoming dangerous. We stopped for lunch and watched two other boats pass through the lock.
We discussed the situation...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stretch of river was only a mile long, we would be travelling with the river flow, it was only just in the red....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We checked the Canal &amp;amp; River Trust's website and there were no warnings about the flood lock (yet), so we took the chance and went for it..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We travelled along a little faster than usual due to the flow of the river, and kept a sharp eye open for trouble.
We could see the flood lock gates in the distance and they were shut.  The approach to the lock was tricky, with a weir immediately on the right and apparently no landing stage on the left until it was revealed at the last minute behind the weeds. It was obviously too short for us. Tony steered for it anyway, fighting with the weir which wanted to drag Liberty Belle towards it. He managed to force Liberty Belle's bow in the corner where the lock gate and landing stage met. I clambered off from the bow, taking the rope with me. After a struggle, Tony managed to straighten Liberty Belle up and I grabbed the middle rope, pulling her in. Tony had to walk along the gunwales from the stern to get off and tie her in place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lock gates were difficult and Tony had to give me a hand but, finally, we got off the river and into the lock. Shortly afterwards we were out on the other side, into the safety of the calm waters of the canal at Mirfield.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;River level in the Red Zone.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lock was closed to traffic by the following morning. With that experience behind us and more rain forecast, we decided to get as many of the river stretches behind us as we could before the river levels rose any more. This meant missing out a short canal arm to Dewsbury, which was a shame.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All went well until we reached a place called Horbury where the river level indicator was well into the red, so we moored up near a pub, prepared to wait as many days as it took for the level to go down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n57/P1260173.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A string of large orange buoys protecting boats on the canal from the nearby weir.&quot; /&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The same bridge, from the other side, looking towards Liberty Belle.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it turned out, we were able to move off the following day, the river level now being in the green! So we set off for Wakefield, a place I must admit I had not heard of but turned out to be a very pleasant surprise. We stayed for a couple of nights to give us a chance to look around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wakefield's Cathedral was particularly friendly and welcoming. We visited the cafe there for tea &amp;amp; cake and liked it so much we went back for lunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Wakefield museum was made especially interesting with its displays about the Victorian Eco-warrier, explorer, taxidermist and eccentric Charles Waterton.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n57/P1260201.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A large brick warehouse, stone warehouse and a modern apartment development beside the entrance to the canal basin.&quot; /&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After making the most of the lovely Wakefield, we set off early the next morning. In front of us was a long stretch of river that we had no intention of dawdling on in case the levels rose again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The river was wide and fed into a wide stretch of canal. The locks were massive and electrically controlled, so my job was easy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n57/P1260216.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The canal split in two and passing over two aqueducts.&quot; /&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Liberty Belle dwarfed by the lock.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;It makes a change from trying to fit in diagonally!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We arrived in Leeds and were lucky to find a 48 hour mooring in Leeds Dock within easy reach of the city centre. We got ourselves a map and some advice from the lovely lady in the tourist information office and off we went.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is beautiful architecture in abundance in Leeds. I started off photographing each interesting and lovely building but I eventually gave up and just looked. The Victorian and Edwardian shopping arcades are simply amazing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The museum somehow didn't quite grab us and we tip-toed around the Catholic Cathedral.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During our last evening in Leeds we were relaxing when we heard a strange thumping noise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Was it our water pump? No.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe it was a machine banging in posts...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It sounded like the dinosaur in Jurassic Park, gradually getting nearer and nearer...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually, we saw the cause. Drummers were leading an Indian wedding party to a restaurant opposite our moorings in Leeds Dock. There must have been three or four generations there, all dressed up and in dancing mood! The excitement and joy was infectious. As they enjoyed their party, we had an early night ready for the next day's cruising.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Where Next?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Leeds we will be turning the corner and heading West along the Leeds and Liverpool Canal over the Pennines. We are looking forward to the views and exploring more of Yorkshire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hope to arrive in Liverpool during the second week of September.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rachel Glombek</name></author><category term="LibertyBelle" /><summary type="html">From Brighouse to Leeds 12th - 20th August 2019</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Special Anniversary Edition</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/libertybellenewsletter/libertybelle/2019/08/23/special-anniversary-edition.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Special Anniversary Edition" /><published>2019-08-23T21:25:00+01:00</published><updated>2019-08-23T21:25:00+01:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/libertybellenewsletter/libertybelle/2019/08/23/special-anniversary-edition</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/libertybellenewsletter/libertybelle/2019/08/23/special-anniversary-edition.html">&lt;h2&gt;Special Anniversary Edition&lt;/h2&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;A year on&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wow! It was a whole year ago that we bought Liberty Belle and began our journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;We have travelled along 1163 miles of canal, through 1245 locks.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;We have discovered several ways to sink a canal boat and attempted two of them.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Liberty Belle has gained a few dents and lost some paint along the way.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;We have passed the time of day with lots of people and seen countless boats (mostly moored), some of them more than once!&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;We have visited hamlets, villages, towns &amp;amp; cities, museums, churches, minsters &amp;amp; cathedrals.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;We have weathered all kinds of weather including too hot, too cold, too wet and too windy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What an adventure!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Things we have learnt&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A plan rarely comes together&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;You should never pass a tap without topping up with water&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Steering in reverse is mostly a matter of luck&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Even if you think you don't need fenders at a mooring, you need fenders.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The BBC Weather App talks nonsense&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;There are a few narrow boats called Liberty Belle but most are called Carpe Diem, Narrow Escape or Meander&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;There are no Waitrose shops in the North&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;It's not what a museum has but how it presents it that is important.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Wet coal doesn't burn hot.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Coal is always wet because it is packed in special plastic bags that allow rain in but not out again.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;There is no time to learn a new language or read a book or practice the ukulele or do a crossword or embroider.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;It is possible for a couple to live on a narrow boat for a whole year and remain married...&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Just because there is a mooring space/toilet/elsan point/tap marked on the map, it isn't necessarily there.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Ducks are good mothers and geese are just shit machines&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Despite there being 34,000 canal boats registered there are hardly any actually moving on the canals. We can travel for days without meeting any! (There was a brief flurry one day in June..)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Our fears are usually unfounded.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A day isn't long enough, nor is a year...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Visitors&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We love having visitors! Some pop by for a cuppa, some visit for the day and others stay and travel with us. We don't always remember to take photos of our visitors but here are some we did take...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also had some near misses from Craig (passing by on a train), Aub (a day or so out of sync), Chris and Jan (unknowingly nearby in their camper van)...plus others, I'm sure!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Future Plans&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, bearing in mind that our plans rarely come together...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We intend to travel through Yorkshire, to Liverpool, Lancaster, Cheshire and Wales before heading south for the winter. We still need to study the winter lock stoppages but we think Milton Keynes will be a good winter base. We still have a lot of miles to explore so we will need at least one more summer....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Watch this space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Our travels so far.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;7th - 13th August 2019&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/maps/n55map.png&quot; alt=&quot;Our route&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Our route&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n55/DSCN2430.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Monica sat in the bow feeding ducks.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Monica feeding the ducks in Sowerby Basin&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Leaving Sowerby Bridge we were about to join the Calder &amp;amp; Hebble Canal which has very different locks to those we have been used to. Not only would they require the use of Tony's, (as yet un-tested), home-made hand-spike to operate the paddles but, to make things even more interesting, the locks are a bit too short for Liberty Belle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Great care and vigilance would be needed to prevent her getting her bow caught on the walking platforms of the bottom gates, or her stern on the cill of the top gates....  No pressure!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, with all this excitement ahead of us, Liberty Belle was glad to have Neil and Monica as extra crew.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our first task was to turn Liberty Belle and manoeuvre her into the boatyard so that we could top up our water and diesel, and replaced our empty gas bottle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We met a gentleman there who had cycled 3 miles from his boat to the boatyard to purchase two hand-spikes. I took the opportunity to compare Tony's hand-made one with the genuine article and it looked remarkably similar...thankfully!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n55/P1260062cropped.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A very ornate chimney.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;In the distance, the Wainhouse Tower, built as a chimney for the dye works but never used, it is now a visitor attraction, open on Bank Holidays only.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before braving the first lock we turned up the Halifax Arm to Salterhebble Basin, in the hope of finding something interesting. It was quite pretty but, being next to the sewage works, was a bit stinky. Needless to say, we had the moorings to ourselves!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The canal arm stopped here and there was a footpath following the route of the old canal to Halifax, which we followed to the Shears Inn...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n55/P1260075.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The end of Salterhebble Basin with the Travelodge dining conservatory overlooking the water.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The pretty (but smelly) Salterhebble Basin.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n55/IMG_20190808_120815.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A stone and white painted pub in front of an industrial chimney.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The Shears Inn, a surprise amongst all the industrial buildings.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the temptations offered by the Shears Inn we had our lunch back at the boat. Fortified we felt ready to negotiate the tricky turn into the first lock. Once in position, Tony tied up Liberty Belle and had the honour of being the first to try his hand-spike. We were all relieved to see that it worked.... Phew!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n55/P1260081.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Tony using his Calder and Hebble Handspike in the lock mechanism.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Tony wielding the hand-spike.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within the lock, Liberty Belle was deftly manoeuvred by Tony at the helm and Neil at the bow rope, under the watchful eyes of the rest of the crew wielding the windlass and hand-spike....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The locks are short but wide. The 'trick' is to initially position Liberty Belle in the centre of the lock, with her bow positioned in the 'v' shape where the bottom gates meet, between the two protruding platforms sticking out of the gates. (These platforms are for the person wielding the windlass to stand on whilst lifting the paddles to let out the water).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile her stern is poised dangerously above the cill - a solid lump at the base of the top gates which they sit on to create a seal. (If you remember back to last year, that is what Liberty Belle was caught on when she nearly sank the first time...)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the water begins to drain from the lock, Liberty Belle is lowered and her bow is soon low enough to be pulled into the corner of the lock, underneath one of the projecting platforms, using her bow rope. At the same time, the helmsman moves the stern across to the opposite corner, thus moving in front of the white line that indicates the extremity of the cill and safety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the lock is empty, one of the bottom gates needs to be opened for Liberty Belle to be driven out. As her bow is now behind one of the gates, there is no choice but to open the other. Her bow rope needs to be passed to the opposite side of the lock so that, once the gate is open, she can be hauled from behind the other gate into the gap and freedom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n55/DSCN2484.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Liberty Belle butted against the lock gate between two walkway platforms.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Bow against the lock gates...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n55/DSCN2479.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Liberty Belle's stern butted against the rear lock gates.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;...and stern over the cill line.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our first attempt was a success! We worked as a team as we travelled through the following four locks and our technique was perfected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n55/DSCN2481.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Liberty Belle's bow rope draped over the lock gate for use later.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Bow tucked into the corner, under the platform (rope to hand!)&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n55/DSCN2480.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Tony using the boathook to keep Liberty Belle's stern in the centre of the lock where there is a larger distance to the submerged cill.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Pushing the stern away from the cill using the boathook.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Excuse the backside! Easing my way across the lock gates with the bow rope, ready to pull the bow from behind the gate.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Pencils driven into stumps. There were at least a dozen of these along the canal.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;No idea why.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We arrived in Elland and found a mooring outside the 'Barge &amp;amp; Barrell'. From here we were able to catch up with Garry and Helen again who were kind enough to invite us all into their home for a delicious meal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following day it was time for us to say goodbye to Neil and Monica, who were moving on to the Lake District. They promised to catch up with us again sometime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n55/P1260114.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Liberty Belle moored in Elland Basin with two accompanying swans.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Swans begging for bread at the mooring in Elland.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We stayed at our moorings in Elland for a few days, exploring the local hills, shops and pubs with Garry and Helen as our guides. It is so easy to fall in love with Yorkshire and we are smitten.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of our walks took us up over the hills and back to Halifax where we had another look around and watched some of the Calderdale Pride celebrations in the pouring rain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another took us back above Halifax and then into Brighouse where we were able to check out the mooring possibilities and have a preview of the locks we were going to negotiate the following day, without our extra crew!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result of the locking technique we had perfected with Neil &amp;amp; Monica, as well as our preview of the locks, we travelled to Brighouse without incident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The town proved to have everything we could possibly need to replenish our supplies but most importantly it was close enough for Mary's friends Anne and Mark to visit us. It was lovely to see them and we hope they will come and find us again, although we may have put them off with our stories of nearly sinking....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;7th August 2019&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst we were moored in Sowerby Bridge, we were so close to Halifax that we decided to go there for the day and explore. To save our feet for the tourist trail, we opted for the short train ride rather than the steep climb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our day was full of historical interest. It began by crossing over an interesting cobbled iron footbridge on our way to Sowerby Bridge railway station. Once at the station we had numerous information boards detailing the histories of local people and buildings to keep us amused whilst waiting for our train.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n54/IMG_20190807_102101.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A cast iron footbridge with panels of vertical rods and a cross with curved cast iron crosspieces.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;A cobbled, iron footbridge.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;An information board about the Rochdale Canal.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Halifax itself there are so many interesting places to visit that we were spoilt for choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The beautiful old Halifax railway station building has been replaced by a smaller, modern building. It is now part of the 'Eureka!' complex, the National Children's Museum, which all looks very exciting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the front of the old building is a depiction of John the Baptist carved in stone. More of him later...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n54/DSCN2336.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The old classically styled railway station and new glass building housing the Eureka museum&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;'Eureka!'&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Halifax Minster is dedicated to St. John the Baptist (of course).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Inside we could have paid £3 for a licence to take photos but we were too mean...)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The magnificent wooden ceiling is divided into squares, each one with a coat of arms painted within it. Each of the pews has a little entry gate. I studied these in the hope of finding some indication of individual families having marked them as their own but was disappointed. However, I then found, at the back of the minster, a display of brass plaques which had been removed from the pews, each one with the name of an individual, family or organisation. A few were dated, the oldest being 1699.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tony was impressed by the memorial of an Archbishop of Dublin who specified in his will that his heart and bowels should be interred in the Halifax Minster, whilst the rest of his remains went elsewhere. He has decided that his own will is not nearly complicated enough...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Piece Hall was a welcome refuge for us from the rain. This amazing building, consisting of a sloping square surrounded by individual rooms on 3 floors, was originally built in the 1700's as a market place for cloth. Halifax was famous for its wool cloth. It was woven by local people into 'pieces' 30 yards long and the width of a standard loom. Each 'piece' took one weaver a whole week to produce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each salesman had one of the 315 rooms in the Piece Hall from which he would sell his weavers' 'pieces' from 10-12 on Saturday mornings. This short window in which to purchase the cloth helped to keep the prices high. (Besides, the rest of the week was needed to produce more 'pieces'...)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The building was only used for it's original purpose for 40 years because the large industrial mills took over from the individual spinners and weavers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the Piece Hall has interesting shops and cafes as well as a museum. It's square is the venue for concerts, markets and art installations. It is well worth a visit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Halifax's elaborate Town Hall was designed by the same man, (Charles Barry), who designed The Houses of Parliament. Even the fabulous exterior cannot prepare you for the extravagant design of its central Victoria Hall which takes your breath away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing that became apparent was that Halifax is obsessed with St. John the Baptist who's head, according to local legend, was buried here. His 'likeness' crops up everywhere (often with dripping blood detail) but especially in the Town Hall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As well as their favourite saint, the Town Hall also likes to incorporate their town's initial letter in the decoration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had a quick look around the indoor market which appears to be thriving. The stalls themselves were no more remarkable than in other towns but the building which houses them is beautiful with elaborate entry gates, a central clock, glass ceiling and red dragons!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dean Clough Mill is enormous but a fraction of its original size. It used to be the worlds largest carpet mill but is now a centre for business and the arts. It houses art galleries, which we didn't have time to do justice to, as well as a small theatre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you Halifax, we had a great day out. We didn't have time to see everything of interest so Tony and I certainly intend to return.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The perfect end to the perfect day was our meal in the very popular Syhiba Restaurant back in Sowerby Bridge. We had the biggest Naan I have ever seen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On our way back to the boat we passed the Loose Goose Inn, outside of which were loads of geese, taking up half of the road.  How appropriate!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;21st July - 7th August 2019&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/maps/n53map.png&quot; alt=&quot;Our route&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Our route&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n53/P1250926.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Liberty Belle temporarily moored in a short side arm with part of a crane post protruding from the ground.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;A pretty mooring.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leaving Summit we shared locks with a boat called Amy that we had first seen moored in Littleborough. Amy had been commandeered by the Canal &amp;amp; River Trust to enable some of their engineers to carry out a visual check of the local canal and locks. They were on their way to pick them up a few locks further down the canal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On our way, the water level in one of the pounds between two locks was so low that there was not enough water to float the boats. This was odd as we had recently had so much water that it was flowing over the tops of the gates. We let the two boats down and they lingered in front of the lock whilst we opened both back and front paddles to let extra water through, allowing just enough for the boats to make their way along the centre of the pound in single file to the next lock, without depriving the pound above of too much water. The boats kept to the middle of the canal and eventually made their way into the next lock. Phew.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n53/P1250939.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Water flowing over the top of a pair of lock gates into the lock.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Excess water flooding over the top of the lock gates.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n53/DSCN2272.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Liberty Belle carefully making its way trhough a canal pound with low water levels and mud showing by the bank.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Lack of water in the pound - note the mud on the right.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later, (after Amy had moored to wait for the engineers), we were in a lock when an enthusiastic local woman came to tell us to look out for a large deer with impressive antlers at the top of the next hill. We left Liberty Belle sitting in the lock and took the binoculars. The stag was magnificent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n53/P1250937cropped.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A flightly fuzzy zoomed photo of a stag with huge antlers.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The magnificent stag.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the next lock the ground paddle was too stiff to wind, so I opened the one on the other side but this was insufficient and the gate would not open. Some onlookers, working in a garden on the hill just above us, shouted down that the gate would not open unless I had both paddles open. I explained that the other paddle was too stiff, so they headed down the hill, two men and a boy. In order to demonstrate how impossible it was to wind the other paddle, I walked around the lock and over the bridge to the other side. Needless to say the paddle came up beautifully with no effort required at all. Typical. The more I insisted that it was stuck when I first tried it, the more sceptical they looked!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two men went back to their work leaving the young boy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To change the subject away from my inadequate lock winding, I asked him if he had seen the stag. Yes, of course. The field we had seen it in belonged to his family and the deer regularly visit their goats there. He also explained that they intended to breed the goats so needed to buy a Billy goat and that Hebden Bridge, where we were headed, is known for its duck race. He was a very pleasant and informative young man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Mouse pointer!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We moored at lunch time and managed to get the stern grounded in the process. Oh well.
It began to rain heavily (again), so we stayed at our mooring and got used to the odd angle of the boat!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n53/P1250956.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Liberty Belle in a lock. The lock wall has a lock gate sized indentation a little way from the end.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The locks in this area have been extended.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The indent in the wall shows where the old gates used to be.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n53/P1260004.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A hill beside the canal with a tall round chimney and a stone tower at the end of a mill.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Industrial buildings in a beautiful landscape.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following day, hoping that the water levels wouldn't be low again, we set off to get through the 12 locks to Todmorden. Apart from getting myself covered in black grease which had mysteriously got caked onto the operating mechanisms, all went well until the very last lock...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n53/P1250992.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A long, tall black brick wall beside the canal.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The Great Wall of Tod.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The wall flanking the canal approaching Todmorden.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;(It supports the railway line.)&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lock in the centre of Todmorden is a guillotine lock. The top gate and its paddles are operated by hand, as usual, but the bottom gate is electronically operated from a press-button panel which had rather a lot of instructions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We got Liberty Belle into the lock in the normal manner and closed the gates behind her. The water level here was high and it was pouring over the top gate, so Liberty Belle was as high in the lock as it was possible to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went to read the instructions.... I read them a couple of times and realised that the paddles to release the water from the lock had to be operated manually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Tony popped over to see what the delay was and Liberty Belle drifted diagonally in the lock, which wouldn't normally be a problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started to operate the paddles, the water began to leave the lock and Liberty Belle began to lower with the water. Well, most of her did but her bow was caught on the side of the lock! She was suddenly at a very precarious angle, with the stern almost under water...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I let down the paddles as quickly as I could to prevent more water from leaving and dashed over to the other end of the lock to raise the paddle there to let water in, (my shirt getting caught in the mechanism and ripping up the front in the process...) and hopefully raise Liberty Belle before she was completely engulfed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, Tony realised what was happening. Not wishing to go down with the ship, he scampered along the gunwales and jumped off. He tried to push her bow off the side of the lock but she remained stuck fast. He shouted to me to hurry, convinced that it was too late and all was lost.

&lt;p&gt;At the last second, Liberty Belle started to rise and right herself. Wow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, with Liberty Belle straightened, her bilge checked for water, the onlookers entranced and our hearts in our mouths we started the process again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time the process went ahead as it should but the gate would not open. The onlookers got involved. Everyone studied the instructions and offered advice. We decided that the water leaking into the lock over the top of the gates was keeping it topped up enough to prevent the lock gate sensors from allowing the gate to operate.&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;Tony phoned the number displayed on the control panel for assistance and help was summoned.
In the meantime we tried again. This time it opened, at last.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We must have been in that lock for 40 minutes before we finally escaped! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we moored up just beyond the lock, we had a return phone call telling us that help was on its way.  Tony nonchalantly assured them that we no longer needed any assistance....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were under the gaze of people eating in canal-side restaurants and cafes in the middle of Todmorden. I was full of adrenaline, a bit manic, covered in black grease and only just wearing my shirt. I must have been a scary sight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tony and I went off to Todmorden's micro-pub to celebrate still being alive and still having a boat...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n53/P1250995.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;rachel stood by the lock operating instructions, reading.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Carefully studying the instructions...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Blessed release!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n53/IMG-20190801-WA0001.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Tony returning from the bar with a glass of beer and a pot of nuts!&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;A pint and a bowl of wild garlic roasted nuts,&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;just the thing.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our next stop was at Stubbings Wharf, just outside Hebden Bridge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst at Stubbings Wharf we were informed that the canal ahead was closed due to the demolition of an old mill that a fire had rendered unstable. Sad though it was for the majestic old building, this enabled us to legitimately outstay our mooring restriction of 24 hours...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hebden Bridge is a well kept little place with historical buildings, interesting shops, buskers, a market and a wealth of cafes and restaurants. We spent a couple of days exploring the local area (and pubs...) with Garry and Helen as our guides, and then picked up our new temporary crew members, Neil and Monica.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n53/DSCN2280.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Tony and Rachel part way up a steep cobbled path.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;There are no zig-zag paths around here,&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;just straight up, whatever the angle.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After showing Neil and Monica around Hebden Bridge, our first task was to move through 3 locks to the boaters' facilities. Having achieved this, Tony then squeezed Liberty Belle into a very tight mooring space, bumper to bumper between two other boats. (One owner, just locking up his boat, loitered outside to make sure we didn't do any damage.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seemingly thrilled with their short trip, Neil &amp;amp; Monica treated us to a delicious evening meal in a local Greek restaurant. Yummm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was much excitement ahead for Liberty Belle and her crew. We had Tuel Lock in Sowerby Bridge to pass through. It is the deepest lock on the canal network, manned by a volunteer lock keeper and passage through needs to be booked ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a fortifying breakfast we set off. On arrival the lock keeper said he needed no assistance so we could all stay on board for the full experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n53/P1260041.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Monica, Neil and Tony (making a Benny Hill comical salute) at the stern of Liberty Belle as she descends the lock.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Going down!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n53/P1260050.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Monica, Neil and Tony at the stern of Liberty Belle dwarfed by the lock gates as she leaves the lock.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Leaving Tuel Lock.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;You can just see the tiny Monica, Neil and Tony at the stern
with the gates towering above them.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were expecting to operate the next lock on our own but were met by several Canal &amp;amp; River Trust engineers who were trying to establish why a section of the lock side had collapsed into a large hole. They operated the lock slowly whilst they carried out their investigation. We were thanked for our patience but we were just glad to be released safely...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n53/P1260055.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Three engineers inspect the hole in the ground and the lowering water klevels in the lock with Neil, Monica and Rachel observing.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Watching the engineers...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The junction where the Rochdale Canal turns into the Calder and Hebble.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We found a mooring around the corner in Sowerby Basin, opposite the boatyard. It wasn't perfect, being on a bend, but it was good enough and we were able to watch a little creature busying himself around the basin, in and out of the water. At first we thought it was a ferret but it turned out to be a small, wild, chocolate coloured mink. Very much a pest but still fun to watch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tony had taken the opportunity earlier in the week to order, online, some new filters for Liberty Belle's engine from a local supplier, knowing that he would soon be within walking distance to collect them. The supplier had been so surprised that a man who had a Southampton postcode was coming to Halifax to collect his order just to save £6 on postage, that he rang him up to check that he hadn't made a mistake... Off Tony went up an almost vertical hill towards Halifax to collect his purchase - it took him rather longer than he had thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we were so close to Halifax, we decided to go there for the day. But that's another story...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;xmp&gt;
We’re going to walk to Todmorden.

We’re going to go the high way.
 

We’re not daunted!

What a beautiful day!
 

Up the rickety steps,

Woops, whoa, hup!
 

Along the nettle-y path,

Ouch, ooch, ouuch!
 

Past the reversing trucks,

Beep, beep, beep!
 

Up the tarmac’d lane,

March, march, march
 

What’s happened to our path?

Huh? Where? Back there!
 

Back down the tarmac’d lane,

Huff, huff, huff.
 

Up the steep track,

Puff, puff, puff
 

Onto the boggy path,

Squelch, squelch, squelch
 

Stop and look at the views,

Wow, wow, wow!
 

Watch the wind-farm blades,

Spin, spin, spin.
 

Follow the reservoir walk,

Stride, step, stride.
 

Turn onto the stone-flagged path,

Clomp, clomp, clomp.
 

Up onto Gaddings Dam,

Stroll, amble, stroll.
 

Look again at the views,

Gosh, wow, gosh!
 

It’s the highest ever beach*,

Where? There? How?
 

Lookout, here come the cows!

Quick, move, go!
 

Down the stone steps,

Careful, one at a time..
 

Down the steep rugged path,

Woops, steady, woah!
 

Down the flights of steps,

Step after step after step...
 

Over the stone canal bridge,

Trip, trap, trip.
 

Time for a little snack I think,

Slurp, chomp, slurp.
 

Charity shop DVD’s,

4 for £1? Yes please.
 

Hide under the stall from the rain,

Drip, drop, drip.
 

Share our fish and chips,

Chomp, chomp, chomp.
 

Back over the canal bridge,

Trip, trap, trip.
 

Along the wet towpath

Splash, splosh, splish.

 

Past the curious dog,

Sniff, snuff, sniff.
 

Sorry, we've eaten all the chips,

Sniff, oh, sniff.
 

Past the reversing trucks,

Beep, beep, beep.
 

Along the nettle-y path,

Ouch, ooch, ouuch!
 

Down the rickety steps,

Woops, whoa, steady!
 

Back onto the boat, 

Have you got the key?
 

Who’s first for the loo?

Me, me, meee!
 

What a wonderful walk.

Look at all that rain!
 

Thankfully back before the storm.

Is it time for tea?
&lt;/xmp&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*Gaddings Dam was built in 1833 high above Todmorden to create a reservoir to supply the local mills. When the mills began to use steam power, the reservoir fell into disuse. Under threat of being drained in 2001 the reservoir was rescued by a determined group of locals who bought the dam, repaired it, and now continue to maintain it. There is a small sandy beach in one corner much loved by the local families who heroically climb the steep, rocky path to the top of the moor to play there and swim in the water. It can get very busy in the hot weather! How wonderful is that?&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The railway track often follows the canal, side by side, so trains are a common sight for us but a steam train is a real treat!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, where were we? Oh yes, Leamington Spa...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our week in Cornwall was so delightful that we extended it to almost 2 weeks..! We finally arrived back in Leamington Spa to find Liberty Belle safe and sound, (if a little dusty), exactly where we had left her. Phew!&lt;p /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our first jobs were to get the washing done and to do some food shopping, so we went to Morrisons. Yes, Morrisons in Leamington Spa has a launderette! The washing machine sends you a text message when it has almost finished so that you can go and get your shopping done whilst you wait. How amazing is that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n50/IMG-20190621-WA0004.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The self service laundrette in the Morrisons car park&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Morrisons in Leamington Spa is just yards from the canal and has this amazing facility. It's surprising the things that get me excited these days...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Garry, Helen and Jack were hot on our heels. Travelling from the campsite in Cornwall back to Yorkshire, they stopped off to spend a couple of days with us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all cruised along the Saltisford Arm to spend the day exploring sunny Warwick, finishing our very pleasant day with an evening BBQ at our delightful mooring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n50/P1250270cropped.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Helen and Garry peering over the front of the boat&quot; /&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The best view we could find of Warwick Castle without spending £29 each...!!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following day, despite the rain, we all faced the Hatton flight of 21 locks, Garry attacking them with gusto, shooting us along the canal to our mooring near Hatton railway station. From here, Garry, Helen and Jack continued their journey North, promising to catch up with us again in Yorkshire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n50/P7062483.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Some of the 21 loack on the Hatton flight&quot; /&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Garry is just a blurr...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tony left from Hatton too, catching the train back to the house to get some weeding done. So, suddenly alone, I took the opportunity to give Liberty Belle a bit of a Spring clean (better late than never!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In between cleaning jobs, I had a little look around at Hatton, hoping to find a nice loaf of bread. The village itself is very small with a pretty church, (closed). It has lots of mature Limeflower trees in the churchyard and lining the main road, which smelt lovely. However, as far as I could tell, it doesn’t have a shop of any kind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the opposite side of the canal is an old farm which is now Hatton shopping village, restaurant, cafe, hairdressers, children’s adventure park, garden centre, swimming pool, escape room, woodland school....complete with a very large car park. Sadly I couldn’t find a single thing to buy, certainly not some bread.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further along the canal, over the top of a tunnel, is the village of Shrewley, so I wandered along to see what was for sale there. I was encouraged by a sign directing me to the Village Deli. Ah, now we’re talking! Unfortunately, their idea of a deli and mine didn’t seem to match. What they meant was a village store selling packaged sandwiches and pies…. Hmmm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to do without bread.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n50/IMG_20190711_114932.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Rachel cream tea at the Hatton Locks Cafe&quot; /&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;No bread? Eat scones...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tony finally came back 5 days later, not because the weeding was finished but because we needed to get moving if we were to get through Manchester before the schools broke up for the summer! Creating mayhem for boaters is a holiday pastime along the canals in Manchester...our guide book suggests boaters start the 15 locks along the Aston Canal into Manchester before 10 am and to avoid school holidays. We had 2 weeks, which was a bit tight...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n50/P1250303.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The twin Shrewley tunnels. A large one for boats and a smaller one above and to the side for horses&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Shrewley has two tunnels, one for boats and one for horses (or pedestrians).&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Originally the horse would have been unhitched and the boaters would have to 'leg it' through tunnels.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;This involved lying on the top of the boat and walking your legs along the inside of the tunnel. Teams of local men could be employed for this purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n50/P1250314.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The bank of the canal narrowed by a landslide&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;A landslide making the canal rather narrow.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It felt good to be on the move again. The weather was calm and sunny, and we spotted two kingfishers during the morning. Lovely. The canal was lined with Buddleia, willowherbs and Meadowsweet, intertwined with a pretty purple vetch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We made brief stops at Kingswood Junction, (to use the facilities there) and Knowle, (where they do know what a Deli is...).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n50/P1250338.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A cast iron bridge over a lock with a narrow gap in the middle&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Kingswood Jumction has fine examples of split bridges over the locks which allowed the rope between the horse and boat to pass through without unhitching...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n50/P1250342.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A white-washed canalside cottage with a curved roof and more modern flat-roofed extension&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;....as well as a barrel roofed lock keepers cottage.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soon the countryside was left behind as we got closer to Birmingham.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Travelling through Birmingham has previously been a pleasant experience, but worrying about Manchester had made me nervous of city locks. On top of that, the weather had taken a turn and the wind was beginning to affect the steering. On balance, I decided that I was more nervous of crashing Liberty Belle than meeting 'undesirables' at the locks so Tony took the helm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n50/P1250375.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A brick brigde over the canal with two red iron doors connecting to the road above&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Getting closer to the city where the road bridges were built with access hatches to enable fire engines to take up canal water.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n50/P1250383.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A gently sloping brick bridge take the towpath over a side arm&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;One of the many bridges along the towpath in Birmingham built to span the side arms to factories, mills and warehouses.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n50/P1250387.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A cast iron bridge number sign reading '88F'&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;This illustrates how many bridges have been built over the canal since the original bridge 88!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n50/P1250329.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The name on the side of a narrowboat reads 'Wideman on a Narrowboat'&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Hahaha!! We didn't see him but took his word for it!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It all started well but eventually, whilst waiting for a lock to be ready, Liberty Belle was blown against the side of a bridge with quite a thump. She lost some paint and her chimney cover was crushed... Luckily the top of the stove flue remained undamaged. That sort of thing isn't good for the nerves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple of locks later, I could see from a distance that there was a group of young men gathered there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh dear, here we go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Try to look calm and relaxed...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I got closer I could see that they were a group of six young men, in their late teens or early twenties sitting in a tight circle, discussing something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remain calm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the young men turned to look at me and I smiled. He smiled back and turned back to his group. So far so good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok...just operate the lock and try not to attract attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I overheard some of their chat. Something about buying and selling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trying to look as if I was only interested in the lock, I took a quick look into the centre of the group...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What a shock! They were playing Monopoly! Yes, really! In this wind! No wonder they were keeping their group tight, they didn't want the money to be blown away...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All my nerves were released in a loud guffaw! They weren't sure what was so funny, but smiled politely...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We made it through Birmingham without further incident. I just hope our experience in Manchester is just as good and that the young people are as busy with board games as those in Birmingham...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;...and out again.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;13th - 29th July 2019&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Our route&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n51/P1250473.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Liberty Belle following another boat and passing and oncoming boat.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The canal gets busy...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Birmingham behind us we headed towards Manchester.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We stopped off briefly to have a look around Lichfield on the way. We didn't have much time but saw enough to know that we would like to come back and have a proper look around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n51/DSCN1990.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The cathedral wall covered in carvings and statues.&quot; /&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n51/DSCN1993.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A sundial on a carved stone pillar.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;In the foreground (and difficult to pick out) is the unusual sundial on a post.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suddenly the canal became so busy we were travelling in convoy, meeting boats at every bridge and had to queue for the water tap and the locks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n51/DSCN2010.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Liberty Belle passing through a narrow channel which was once a tunnel.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;A tunnel (with its roof removed). Thankfully, on such a busy day, we didn't meet a boat coming the other way!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n51/DSCN2004.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Boats queuing for the lock at Fradley Junction.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Liberty Belle is third in the queue for the lock.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we reached Rugeley we stopped and took photos of a bridge for our friend Aub, (fishing legend), as we had promised. He has fond memories of fishing there and watching the trains pass by as a boy. Aub's is a turnover bridge, where the towpath changes from one side to the other. Some of the turnover bridges in this area are delightful 'snake' bridges, where the horse could walk over the canal without being unhitched from the boat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n51/P1250531.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The turnover bridge wher Aub fished as a boy.&quot; /&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n51/DSCN2146.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A stone turnover bridge with a helta-skelta like stone path to the top.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;A snake bridge.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n51/P1250450.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A footbridge with a white castellated tower at each end.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;How fancy! &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n51/P1250550.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A wrough iron footbridge suspended between stone abutments.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;A smart footbridge. &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following day we stopped off at Great Haywood to make use of the facilities and have a little look around. We walked along to the canalside farm shop and on the way took a little diversion to peep into one of their greenhouses. Suddenly Tony  managed to scoop up a bee with his sandal. Neither Tony nor the bee enjoyed the experience, but I suspect the bee came off worst. I suggested Tony go back to the boat but he decided that, if he suffered an anaphylactic shock, he would be better off in a busy shop than alone on the boat. He limped around the shop until the pain wore off then declared he had no money with him anyway, so off we went back to Liberty Belle to continue on our way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;To the Potteries!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our next mooring was at Weston where we met an ex-boater in The Woolpack who warned us not to stop along the next stretch of the canal because of all the beggars. Oh heck...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later that evening, Tony was doing some planning for our journey ahead and discovered that we would need a hand spike for some of the Yorkshire locks. A special tool needed to operate the ground paddles. Oh for goodness sake!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next stretch of canal turned out to be lovely, with no sign of any beggars....what was that all about?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;...and some of their recent mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Tony at the helm we headed for the Harecastle tunnel and, after a brief safety talk, we were ushered straight in. My goodness it was stressful. It was dark, narrow, noisy (due to the air extraction), low, long and not quite straight. It took about 40 minutes to travel through and it was a relief to escape!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n51/P1250635.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A Canal and River Trust work boat which we were told would eventually rescue us if we broke down in the tunnel.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The rescue boat poised outside the tunnel, just in case.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the tunnel we turned onto the Macclesfield canal which was beautiful all the way along. There was bridge after bridge as well as narrow pinches where there used to be swing bridges. For some reason people needed to cross this canal in far more places than other canals!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n51/P1250698.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Two stone bridges over the canal only yards apart.&quot; /&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Were they happy neighbours?&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Did they fight to help the boats through or did each hope the other would do it?&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;If walls could speak...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We climbed the hill to Macclesfield through some lovely locks with beautiful views, even in the pouring rain! By the time we moored at Bollington the rain had stopped and we climbed to a local view point. We were taken aback by the fabulous 360 degree views and delighted by what we saw of the village.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;A pretty Mandarin Duck.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;She had several, almost fully grown, youngsters.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We progressed to Marple junction where we hoped to moor for the night but there was no space so we had little choice but to start down the next flight of locks. A young man sped us up by helping us through every single one, bless him. A little boy called Oscar also tried to help, so Tony gave him and his dad a ride down one lock and through to the next. There were several onlookers, all very friendly and interested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We finally moored at 9pm in Ashton-under-Lyne, vowing to get up early in the morning to face the Ashton Canal. This stretch of canal into Manchester is known for the trouble caused by young lads boarding boats and intimidating boaters. We had rushed to get here before the school holidays and intended to complete all the locks whilst any lads not attending school were still in bed!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To further complicate matters, a swing bridge between the second and third locks was broken and could only be operated by a Canal &amp;amp; River Trust employee who would be there for one hour  between 8 &amp;amp; 9 am, and then 4 &amp;amp; 5pm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was quite hard work, especially with the wind trying to blow Liberty Belle out of line with the locks, but it all went surprisingly well. The towpath was smart and well used by friendly people making their way to school and work. We arrived in Manchester without any trouble at all and found a pleasant mooring in a residential area near an aqueduct. What was all the fuss about?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We went to look for somewhere in town to have lunch. We seemed to be the only boat in Manchester. As we ventured further along we discovered that the canal side was populated by drunks and drug users. We didn’t have any trouble from them really as they all seemed either cheerful &amp;amp; friendly or passed out, but I was definitely out of my comfort zone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Manchester itself is an interesting city, packed with wonderful architecture both old and new. We decided to take a day off boating and  spend the following day having a proper look around. We discovered the Clink cafe (a charity helping ex-offenders) which had good coffee, tasty flapjacks and a pleasant atmosphere. The menu looked interesting and affordable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the recommendation of Garry we went to The Industry &amp;amp; Science Museum which took up most of our day. This is well worth a visit, if only for the working mill machinery converting cotton bails to calico. There are plenty of reasons to go back to the city so we have added it to our list of places to re-visit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n51/IMG-20190723-WA0000.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A view inside the Industy and Science Museun showing machines from a cotton mill.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Some of the old cotton mill machines used to demonstrate the making of calico which Manchester was famous for. Apparently the damp atmosphere due to the heavy rainfall was essential to the process.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;These lock gates are opened and closed by winding chains. A new experience!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, promising to return, we set off through Manchester. My goodness it was hard work. The sun beat down on us, the canal was shallow, due to collapsed overflow channels letting the water out, full of rubbish and, although the  lock paddles were easy to operate, they had badly positioned steps and railings making access difficult. Some were very deep indeed and Tony had to climb up steep, slimey ladders in order to hold onto Liberty Belle’s rope to keep her reasonably still in the double width locks. It was difficult to moor because we couldn’t get to the edge without getting grounded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One lock gate refused to move. I gave it everything I had, then Tony joined me and we were both defeated by it. Two passers-by joined in but it wouldn’t budge. Another boat (with a film crew making a series called Canal Boat Diaries for BBC4) came along and tried to contact the Canal &amp;amp; River Trust who weren’t answering the phone (!?). Finally, with four of us shoving &amp;amp; heaving at the bloomin’ thing, we got it open. It took me several days to recover physically from that episode...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had to steer around poles and signs indicating underwater obstacles and a motorbike, just sticking up above the water. We mentioned this to a couple of people we met who just seemed to think we were lucky it wasn’t a car.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two lads asked us for a lift and when we refused they threw sticky liquid on us from the next two bridges. We were sticking to the deck and the prop had gathered so much junk we were barely moving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was enough for me. I would have gone home that day if it had been an option. Almost in tears, covered in some unknown sticky liquid, in 30 degrees heat, already exhausted, I still had two more locks to do. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We finally arrived at our mooring. We cleaned everything up and showered. What a day!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n51/DSCN2205.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Weed, polythene bags and a bra hauled onto the rear deck of Liberty Belle.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The Manchester souvenirs Tony released from Liberty Belle's propeller.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We set off early again on another unbelievably hot day. Early on we managed to open the top paddles of the lock to fill it without noticing that one of the bottom paddles was still open. It had a different style of indicator that we hadn’t seen before and really, we were too tired. Having drained rather a lot of water from the pound, we realised our mistake. Oh heck. The day didn’t get much better as I managed to leave my windlass at a swing bridge and didn’t notice for about a mile or so and we got grounded at a lock landing point and Tony had to employ the barge pole to heave us back afloat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally we found a mooring in Littleborough. After what we had been through it seemed like paradise! The canal was well kept and the views of the Pennines were pretty and inviting. Phew. Not only that but we are now near enough to Garry and Helen for them to visit us, which is lovely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First we had to get some supplies so we walked to the local Co-op. We arrived to find it surrounded by Police tape - there had been a ram-raid which involved lots of broken glass, smashed beer bottles and scattered toilet roll. So, not quite paradise after all!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our next mooring was at a little place called Summit which is where the canal stops climbing uphill and begins to go back down. We have spent a little time here exploring the countryside. Now that the temperature has gone back down to the early 20’s, I have caught up on my sleep, my body has recovered from all those locks and the views around me are so awesome I can begin to think that the journey through Manchester was worth it...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lucky us!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We now intend to slowly make our way around Yorkshire, appreciating everything it has to offer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n51/DSCN2240.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A stone post marking the Yorkshire-Lancashire border on the canal.&quot; /&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Either way we are safely 19 miles from Manchester.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;1st - 21st June 2019&lt;/h2&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Our route&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n49/P1250152.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A peaceful canal scene with moored boats and fluffy white clouds in a blue sky.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;It's a beautiful day! Heading along the Grand Union towards the junction with the Wendover Arm.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst we were travelling in and around London, the trees around us were busy with bright green parakeets, shouting at one another and generally making a lot of fuss! Otherwise we had our familiar heron, cormorants, gulls, ducks, geese, swans, moorhens and coots, many of them now in family groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;City dwelling coots built their nests with colourful and interesting things woven amongst the twigs. Anything that floats was chosen from plastic bags and takeaway coffee cups to sweet wrappers and even a flip flop! Many of the nests were made on the back ends of boats and in tyres, suspended from boats as fenders. Some boats even had signs asking people not to double moor because they didn't want the coot nesting there to be disturbed!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Talking about wildlife using their initiative, I witnessed a crow catching a fish. He carried it from the canal in his beak to a nearby roof. I watched him as he ate it by pecking it to pieces rather than swallowing it head first as a water bird would have done. Well I never!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n49/P6012075cropped.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A blue sculpture of Paddington Bear doffing his hat to onlookers.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Bye Bye Paddington.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We discovered that Paddington's bit of canal has a special bubble curtain which keeps rubbish out and aerates the water. It is a metal tube, full of small holes, formed into a rectangle and positioned on the bottom of the canal where it has air pumped through it. It is a strange sensation, passing over it in the boat. It feels like the boat has briefly levitated. A small boat which has a conveyor belt tipped over the front of it, removes the debris collected behind the bubble curtain so that it can be disposed of. Clever ol' Paddington! Very neat!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After waving goodbye to dear ol’ Paddington, we turned onto the Regents Canal.
I have always wanted to travel along here, through Little Venice, the park, the zoo and Camden Lock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only zoo animal we saw was a very large pig but apart from that, the journey didn’t disappoint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The weather was beautiful and Camden was packed with people, on the bridges, in the bars and cafes, along the towpath and even enjoying picnics on the locks themselves! We had to ask people to move all their belongings before we could use the steps and swing the gates. The buzzing crowd seemed to be in holiday mood, enjoying the sunshine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;A hot-tub boat.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Yes, really!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had hoped to moor at Limehouse, but there was no space for us so were forced to continue on. We finally found a place to moor at Bow Locks, just between the lock and the railway bridge. Whilst there we had a flying visit from Craig! Well, almost. He passed by us on a train, within a few feet of Liberty Belle!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We set off again the following morning and heard some lively music, which got louder and louder. Finally we came across the source, a boat crowded with people dancing. The party had spread to the outside of the boat and the tow path. We shouted across to them, asking if it was today's party or yesterday's. They confirmed it was yesterday's and invited us to join in. Feeling we would have a lot of catching up to do drink-wise, we waved cheerfully and declined...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We looped back to the Regents Canal, before retracing our journey to Little Venice and along Paddington’s Arm, before heading North along the Grand Onion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Well, almost...&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;ContainerVille.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;At first we thought it was someone's answer to the homeless issue,&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;but no, it's office space. &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we arrived at the junction for the Slough Arm we slowed a little and just peered along it. We decided not to travel down it. Was that a mistake? Sorry Slough. Maybe next time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We try to plan ahead to some degree, plotting roughly where we want to be and when. We had spent rather more time in London than we had foreseen, so now we needed to move along without the luxury of exploring every town and village on the way. However, we do still want to travel the whole of the network if possible, so we try to travel along any canal arms that we can on our way, so that we don't have to come back to complete these extra bits of the network in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&quot;One of these ducklings is not like the others,&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;one of these ducklings is not quite the same&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;(Maybe he's just in a huff..)&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;June had arrived and with it the heady smell of elderflowers, pretty pink wild roses draped over the hedges, waterlilies coming into bud and the occasional dragonfly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we left London behind we began to see Red Kites overhead, wagtails fussing around the locks and kingfishers dashing along in front of us again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Approaching Rickmansworth we could hear chanting. Rather than disturbing the peace, the sound was hypnotic and relaxing, although we had no idea what it was for. We searched the internet later and it turned out to be 'Prayer in the Park' held in a marquee near the canal to celebrate the end of Ramadan. It is obviously a very popular and well attended event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We joined forces with a pleasant young Londoner on his neat little boat with hops growing from pots at the bow. Apparently the hop plant doesn’t really like growing horizontally along the top of a boat but he was determined to make it work as he was brewing his own beer.
He was searching for a quiet mooring to leave his boat whilst he went for a week’s cider drinking in Cornwall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A week in Cornwall? Now there's an idea...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Oops. Someone had a mighty bump!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;I think there is a boat under that lot.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;We had been looking forward to Cowroast Lock. It sounded so yummy!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;We were a little disappointed that there was no free BBQ,
but we did get lock gates so new that they still had the carpenter's marks on them.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n49/P6062211.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The non- slip raised 'buttons' on the lock gate crossing.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;They also had fancy non-slip 'buttons' on them. Ooooo.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We turned down the Wendover Arm, which is under restoration. It is navigable for about 1.5 miles of its 6.75 mile length. We moored Liberty Belle near Tring where the canal currently terminates. Between rain showers we had a quick look around the town and the Church of St. Peter &amp;amp; St. Paul.  The next day the weather was better so we walked to Wendover, checking out the progress of the canal restoration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the return journey back to Liberty Belle we walked over a section of The Ridgeway from Wendover to Tring Park, which was a lovely discovery! The park used to belong to the Rothschilds. Walter Rothschild used to keep his wallabies, zebras, cassowaries and giant tortoises here in the late 1800’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apparently he had trained some of the zebras to pull a cart and used to ride one of the tortoises around, encouraging it forwards with a lettuce leaf! Brilliant!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now it is a haven for wildlife and has a network of well marked trails. After finding our way through the park we next discovered the Tring Natural History Museum (Walter Rothschild again) which took my breath away! For a small market town, Tring has a lot to offer!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On our way out of Tring, back to Liberty Belle, we almost managed to walk past the chippy...almost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After returning to the main canal from the Wendover Arm we travelled down the next arm to Aylesbury. The first two locks on this arm form a short staircase; the second lock is filled by the water expelled from the first. This makes you stop and think for a moment before operating them!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arriving at the third lock, the water was gushing into the lock over the gate at an alarming rate! I was convinced this must be my fault; I must have left the staircase lock in a state where the water was rapidly draining the canal! I dashed back to the staircase lock and couldn't see anything untoward, so we carried on down the locks, but I couldn't shake off the feeling that it was all my fault. Every lock along the arm had an excess of water, whereas there was generally a shortage...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was quite unnerving. We met some local people at a lock and I asked them if it was normal. They said it wasn't, and proceeded to take photos of the waterfall gushing over the lock gate. This wasn't reassuring. I asked them to forget that they had seen us, if it turned out to be my error!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After stopping over at Aylesbury we made our way back to the main canal. The water level was still very high all along the arm. Very odd - where was it all coming from?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we made our way to Milton Keynes, the weather took a turn! So far on our adventure we have only had occasional days of rain, but now we had a full week of it! We couldn't allow it to put us off as we had arranged to collect Cathy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some months before, I had been talking to a lock keeper about the lack of water and had suggested that maybe it would rain for the whole of June, to make up for it. Hmmmm...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We made good time, despite the weather. Cathy, on the other hand, had a difficult journey to Milton Keynes, having trains delayed and cancelled en route, but she got there in the end!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There had been some doubt about our journey beyond Milton Keynes because one of the locks was closed due to damage caused by an 'accidental collision' and a tree had been blown down across the canal. Thankfully the Canal &amp;amp; River Trust was able to complete the work required before it affected us. Well done to them!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The weather continued to be rather wet over the next few days but, with Cathy's help, we made good time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Tony had been fighting with his GPS tracker that turned out not to be as waterproof as we had thought. It failed to plot chunks of our journey so Tony had to manipulate the Liberty Belle maps himself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cathy had to leave us at Norton Junction, to make her way back to Bristol. This time her train journey was straightforward, thankfully.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This area between Berkhamsted and Milton Keynes is so unexpectedly delightful that we are thinking of coming back in the winter, to have more time to explore properly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our next assignment was to get to Leamington Spa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We ticked off the miles and locks with ease. The Yellow Flag Irises that have cheered us along our way are gradually dying back but we are now accompanied by an array of flowers of different colours and shades, including bright red poppies, cheerful Ox-eye Daisies and the determined Red Valerian.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the last day the sun finally came out. We completed the locks and miles in good time and arrived in Leamington Spa, looking for a safe place to moor Liberty Belle near the railway station. We found a stretch along the towpath which wasn't included in the 48 hour mooring signs, so we decided that Liberty Belle could legitimately stay here for a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She can have a break whilst Tony and I go to Cornwall for a well earned rest. (?)&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rachel Glombek</name></author><category term="LibertyBelle" /><summary type="html">From Paddington to Leamington Spa 1st - 21st June 2019</summary></entry></feed>
