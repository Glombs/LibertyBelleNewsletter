&lt;h2&gt;21st June - 13th July 2019&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/maps/n50map.png&quot; alt=&quot;Our route&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Our route&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n50/P1250282.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A steam train passing Hatton&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The railway track often follows the canal, side by side, so trains are a common sight for us but a steam train is a real treat!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, where were we? Oh yes, Leamington Spa...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our week in Cornwall was so delightful that we extended it to almost 2 weeks..! We finally arrived back in Leamington Spa to find Liberty Belle safe and sound, (if a little dusty), exactly where we had left her. Phew!&lt;p /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our first jobs were to get the washing done and to do some food shopping, so we went to Morrisons. Yes, Morrisons in Leamington Spa has a launderette! The washing machine sends you a text message when it has almost finished so that you can go and get your shopping done whilst you wait. How amazing is that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n50/IMG-20190621-WA0004.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The self service laundrette in the Morrisons car park&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Morrisons in Leamington Spa is just yards from the canal and has this amazing facility. It's surprising the things that get me excited these days...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Garry, Helen and Jack were hot on our heels. Travelling from the campsite in Cornwall back to Yorkshire, they stopped off to spend a couple of days with us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all cruised along the Saltisford Arm to spend the day exploring sunny Warwick, finishing our very pleasant day with an evening BBQ at our delightful mooring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n50/P1250270cropped.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Helen and Garry peering over the front of the boat&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Visitors!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Jack, relaxing&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n50/P1250268.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The bridge over the Saltisford canal arm&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Owned by the Saltisford Canal Trust Ltd,

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n50/P7052475.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Warwick Castle from Mill Street&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The best view we could find of Warwick Castle without spending £29 each...!!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following day, despite the rain, we all faced the Hatton flight of 21 locks, Garry attacking them with gusto, shooting us along the canal to our mooring near Hatton railway station. From here, Garry, Helen and Jack continued their journey North, promising to catch up with us again in Yorkshire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n50/P7062483.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Some of the 21 loack on the Hatton flight&quot; /&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n50/P7062484.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Garry winding the locks so fast that he is just a blurr&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Garry is just a blurr...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tony left from Hatton too, catching the train back to the house to get some weeding done. So, suddenly alone, I took the opportunity to give Liberty Belle a bit of a Spring clean (better late than never!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In between cleaning jobs, I had a little look around at Hatton, hoping to find a nice loaf of bread. The village itself is very small with a pretty church, (closed). It has lots of mature Limeflower trees in the churchyard and lining the main road, which smelt lovely. However, as far as I could tell, it doesn’t have a shop of any kind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the opposite side of the canal is an old farm which is now Hatton shopping village, restaurant, cafe, hairdressers, children’s adventure park, garden centre, swimming pool, escape room, woodland school....complete with a very large car park. Sadly I couldn’t find a single thing to buy, certainly not some bread.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further along the canal, over the top of a tunnel, is the village of Shrewley, so I wandered along to see what was for sale there. I was encouraged by a sign directing me to the Village Deli. Ah, now we’re talking! Unfortunately, their idea of a deli and mine didn’t seem to match. What they meant was a village store selling packaged sandwiches and pies…. Hmmm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to do without bread.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n50/IMG_20190711_114932.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Rachel cream tea at the Hatton Locks Cafe&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;No bread? Eat scones...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n50/IMG_20190707_184142.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The canal around the boat is covered in blue-green algae&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Blue-Green algae on the march...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tony finally came back 5 days later, not because the weeding was finished but because we needed to get moving if we were to get through Manchester before the schools broke up for the summer! Creating mayhem for boaters is a holiday pastime along the canals in Manchester...our guide book suggests boaters start the 15 locks along the Aston Canal into Manchester before 10 am and to avoid school holidays. We had 2 weeks, which was a bit tight...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n50/P1250303.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The twin Shrewley tunnels. A large one for boats and a smaller one above and to the side for horses&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Shrewley has two tunnels, one for boats and one for horses (or pedestrians).&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Originally the horse would have been unhitched and the boaters would have to 'leg it' through tunnels.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;This involved lying on the top of the boat and walking your legs along the inside of the tunnel. Teams of local men could be employed for this purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n50/P1250293.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The smaller stone horse tunnel with ribbed flour for the horse to get a grip&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n50/P1250314.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The bank of the canal narrowed by a landslide&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;A landslide making the canal rather narrow.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It felt good to be on the move again. The weather was calm and sunny, and we spotted two kingfishers during the morning. Lovely. The canal was lined with Buddleia, willowherbs and Meadowsweet, intertwined with a pretty purple vetch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We made brief stops at Kingswood Junction, (to use the facilities there) and Knowle, (where they do know what a Deli is...).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n50/P1250338.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A cast iron bridge over a lock with a narrow gap in the middle&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Kingswood Jumction has fine examples of split bridges over the locks which allowed the rope between the horse and boat to pass through without unhitching...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n50/P1250342.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A white-washed canalside cottage with a curved roof and more modern flat-roofed extension&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;....as well as a barrel roofed lock keepers cottage.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soon the countryside was left behind as we got closer to Birmingham.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Travelling through Birmingham has previously been a pleasant experience, but worrying about Manchester had made me nervous of city locks. On top of that, the weather had taken a turn and the wind was beginning to affect the steering. On balance, I decided that I was more nervous of crashing Liberty Belle than meeting 'undesirables' at the locks so Tony took the helm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n50/P1250375.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A brick brigde over the canal with two red iron doors connecting to the road above&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Getting closer to the city where the road bridges were built with access hatches to enable fire engines to take up canal water.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n50/P1250383.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A gently sloping brick bridge take the towpath over a side arm&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;One of the many bridges along the towpath in Birmingham built to span the side arms to factories, mills and warehouses.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n50/P1250387.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A cast iron bridge number sign reading '88F'&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;This illustrates how many bridges have been built over the canal since the original bridge 88!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n50/P1250329.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The name on the side of a narrowboat reads 'Wideman on a Narrowboat'&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Hahaha!! We didn't see him but took his word for it!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It all started well but eventually, whilst waiting for a lock to be ready, Liberty Belle was blown against the side of a bridge with quite a thump. She lost some paint and her chimney cover was crushed... Luckily the top of the stove flue remained undamaged. That sort of thing isn't good for the nerves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple of locks later, I could see from a distance that there was a group of young men gathered there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh dear, here we go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Try to look calm and relaxed...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I got closer I could see that they were a group of six young men, in their late teens or early twenties sitting in a tight circle, discussing something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remain calm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the young men turned to look at me and I smiled. He smiled back and turned back to his group. So far so good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok...just operate the lock and try not to attract attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I overheard some of their chat. Something about buying and selling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trying to look as if I was only interested in the lock, I took a quick look into the centre of the group...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What a shock! They were playing Monopoly! Yes, really! In this wind! No wonder they were keeping their group tight, they didn't want the money to be blown away...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All my nerves were released in a loud guffaw! They weren't sure what was so funny, but smiled politely...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We made it through Birmingham without further incident. I just hope our experience in Manchester is just as good and that the young people are as busy with board games as those in Birmingham...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n50/P1250413.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Colourful graffiti on the side of a bridge reading 'iBS'&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The good folk of Birmingham appear to have a strangely celebratory attitude to Irritable Bowel Syndrome...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n50/P1250397.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A slightly sinister view back to the Salford junction under two road bridges&quot; /&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Are we in the correct lane?&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Under we go....&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n50/P1250409.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;and on top of the tunnel as we emerge, black corrugated iron industrial buildings&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;...and out again.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;.. not as easy as driving&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;13th - 29th July 2019&lt;/h2&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Our route&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n51/P1250473.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Liberty Belle following another boat and passing and oncoming boat.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The canal gets busy...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Birmingham behind us we headed towards Manchester.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We stopped off briefly to have a look around Lichfield on the way. We didn't have much time but saw enough to know that we would like to come back and have a proper look around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n51/DSCN1990.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The cathedral wall covered in carvings and statues.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;A glimpse of the inside...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n51/DSCN1993.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A sundial on a carved stone pillar.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;In the foreground (and difficult to pick out) is the unusual sundial on a post.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suddenly the canal became so busy we were travelling in convoy, meeting boats at every bridge and had to queue for the water tap and the locks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n51/DSCN2010.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Liberty Belle passing through a narrow channel which was once a tunnel.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;A tunnel (with its roof removed). Thankfully, on such a busy day, we didn't meet a boat coming the other way!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n51/DSCN2004.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Boats queuing for the lock at Fradley Junction.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Liberty Belle is third in the queue for the lock.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we reached Rugeley we stopped and took photos of a bridge for our friend Aub, (fishing legend), as we had promised. He has fond memories of fishing there and watching the trains pass by as a boy. Aub's is a turnover bridge, where the towpath changes from one side to the other. Some of the turnover bridges in this area are delightful 'snake' bridges, where the horse could walk over the canal without being unhitched from the boat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n51/P1250531.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The turnover bridge wher Aub fished as a boy.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Aub's turnover bridge.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n51/DSCN2146.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A stone turnover bridge with a helta-skelta like stone path to the top.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;A snake bridge.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n51/P1250450.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A footbridge with a white castellated tower at each end.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;How fancy! &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n51/P1250550.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A wrough iron footbridge suspended between stone abutments.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;A smart footbridge. &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following day we stopped off at Great Haywood to make use of the facilities and have a little look around. We walked along to the canalside farm shop and on the way took a little diversion to peep into one of their greenhouses. Suddenly Tony  managed to scoop up a bee with his sandal. Neither Tony nor the bee enjoyed the experience, but I suspect the bee came off worst. I suggested Tony go back to the boat but he decided that, if he suffered an anaphylactic shock, he would be better off in a busy shop than alone on the boat. He limped around the shop until the pain wore off then declared he had no money with him anyway, so off we went back to Liberty Belle to continue on our way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;To the Potteries!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our next mooring was at Weston where we met an ex-boater in The Woolpack who warned us not to stop along the next stretch of the canal because of all the beggars. Oh heck...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later that evening, Tony was doing some planning for our journey ahead and discovered that we would need a hand spike for some of the Yorkshire locks. A special tool needed to operate the ground paddles. Oh for goodness sake!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next stretch of canal turned out to be lovely, with no sign of any beggars....what was that all about?&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;What a disappointment! You would think Wedgwood would have a better looking factory than that!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;...and some of their recent mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Tony at the helm we headed for the Harecastle tunnel and, after a brief safety talk, we were ushered straight in. My goodness it was stressful. It was dark, narrow, noisy (due to the air extraction), low, long and not quite straight. It took about 40 minutes to travel through and it was a relief to escape!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The rescue boat poised outside the tunnel, just in case.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the tunnel we turned onto the Macclesfield canal which was beautiful all the way along. There was bridge after bridge as well as narrow pinches where there used to be swing bridges. For some reason people needed to cross this canal in far more places than other canals!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n51/P1250698.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Two stone bridges over the canal only yards apart.&quot; /&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Were they happy neighbours?&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Did they fight to help the boats through or did each hope the other would do it?&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;If walls could speak...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We climbed the hill to Macclesfield through some lovely locks with beautiful views, even in the pouring rain! By the time we moored at Bollington the rain had stopped and we climbed to a local view point. We were taken aback by the fabulous 360 degree views and delighted by what we saw of the village.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;A pretty Mandarin Duck.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;She had several, almost fully grown, youngsters.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We progressed to Marple junction where we hoped to moor for the night but there was no space so we had little choice but to start down the next flight of locks. A young man sped us up by helping us through every single one, bless him. A little boy called Oscar also tried to help, so Tony gave him and his dad a ride down one lock and through to the next. There were several onlookers, all very friendly and interested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We finally moored at 9pm in Ashton-under-Lyne, vowing to get up early in the morning to face the Ashton Canal. This stretch of canal into Manchester is known for the trouble caused by young lads boarding boats and intimidating boaters. We had rushed to get here before the school holidays and intended to complete all the locks whilst any lads not attending school were still in bed!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To further complicate matters, a swing bridge between the second and third locks was broken and could only be operated by a Canal &amp;amp; River Trust employee who would be there for one hour  between 8 &amp;amp; 9 am, and then 4 &amp;amp; 5pm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was quite hard work, especially with the wind trying to blow Liberty Belle out of line with the locks, but it all went surprisingly well. The towpath was smart and well used by friendly people making their way to school and work. We arrived in Manchester without any trouble at all and found a pleasant mooring in a residential area near an aqueduct. What was all the fuss about?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We went to look for somewhere in town to have lunch. We seemed to be the only boat in Manchester. As we ventured further along we discovered that the canal side was populated by drunks and drug users. We didn’t have any trouble from them really as they all seemed either cheerful &amp;amp; friendly or passed out, but I was definitely out of my comfort zone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Manchester itself is an interesting city, packed with wonderful architecture both old and new. We decided to take a day off boating and  spend the following day having a proper look around. We discovered the Clink cafe (a charity helping ex-offenders) which had good coffee, tasty flapjacks and a pleasant atmosphere. The menu looked interesting and affordable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the recommendation of Garry we went to The Industry &amp;amp; Science Museum which took up most of our day. This is well worth a visit, if only for the working mill machinery converting cotton bails to calico. There are plenty of reasons to go back to the city so we have added it to our list of places to re-visit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n51/IMG-20190723-WA0000.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A view inside the Industy and Science Museun showing machines from a cotton mill.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Some of the old cotton mill machines used to demonstrate the making of calico which Manchester was famous for. Apparently the damp atmosphere due to the heavy rainfall was essential to the process.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n51/IMG-20190723-WA0003.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A winding mechanism with chains used to open lock gates to which access has been restricted by a modern road bridge.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;These lock gates are opened and closed by winding chains. A new experience!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, promising to return, we set off through Manchester. My goodness it was hard work. The sun beat down on us, the canal was shallow, due to collapsed overflow channels letting the water out, full of rubbish and, although the  lock paddles were easy to operate, they had badly positioned steps and railings making access difficult. Some were very deep indeed and Tony had to climb up steep, slimey ladders in order to hold onto Liberty Belle’s rope to keep her reasonably still in the double width locks. It was difficult to moor because we couldn’t get to the edge without getting grounded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One lock gate refused to move. I gave it everything I had, then Tony joined me and we were both defeated by it. Two passers-by joined in but it wouldn’t budge. Another boat (with a film crew making a series called Canal Boat Diaries for BBC4) came along and tried to contact the Canal &amp;amp; River Trust who weren’t answering the phone (!?). Finally, with four of us shoving &amp;amp; heaving at the bloomin’ thing, we got it open. It took me several days to recover physically from that episode...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had to steer around poles and signs indicating underwater obstacles and a motorbike, just sticking up above the water. We mentioned this to a couple of people we met who just seemed to think we were lucky it wasn’t a car.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two lads asked us for a lift and when we refused they threw sticky liquid on us from the next two bridges. We were sticking to the deck and the prop had gathered so much junk we were barely moving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was enough for me. I would have gone home that day if it had been an option. Almost in tears, covered in some unknown sticky liquid, in 30 degrees heat, already exhausted, I still had two more locks to do. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We finally arrived at our mooring. We cleaned everything up and showered. What a day!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n51/DSCN2205.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Weed, polythene bags and a bra hauled onto the rear deck of Liberty Belle.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The Manchester souvenirs Tony released from Liberty Belle's propeller.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We set off early again on another unbelievably hot day. Early on we managed to open the top paddles of the lock to fill it without noticing that one of the bottom paddles was still open. It had a different style of indicator that we hadn’t seen before and really, we were too tired. Having drained rather a lot of water from the pound, we realised our mistake. Oh heck. The day didn’t get much better as I managed to leave my windlass at a swing bridge and didn’t notice for about a mile or so and we got grounded at a lock landing point and Tony had to employ the barge pole to heave us back afloat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally we found a mooring in Littleborough. After what we had been through it seemed like paradise! The canal was well kept and the views of the Pennines were pretty and inviting. Phew. Not only that but we are now near enough to Garry and Helen for them to visit us, which is lovely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First we had to get some supplies so we walked to the local Co-op. We arrived to find it surrounded by Police tape - there had been a ram-raid which involved lots of broken glass, smashed beer bottles and scattered toilet roll. So, not quite paradise after all!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our next mooring was at a little place called Summit which is where the canal stops climbing uphill and begins to go back down. We have spent a little time here exploring the countryside. Now that the temperature has gone back down to the early 20’s, I have caught up on my sleep, my body has recovered from all those locks and the views around me are so awesome I can begin to think that the journey through Manchester was worth it...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lucky us!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We now intend to slowly make our way around Yorkshire, appreciating everything it has to offer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n51/DSCN2240.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A stone post marking the Yorkshire-Lancashire border on the canal.&quot; /&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Either way we are safely 19 miles from Manchester.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;A pretty mooring space.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Our route&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n49/P1250152.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A peaceful canal scene with moored boats and fluffy white clouds in a blue sky.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;It's a beautiful day! Heading along the Grand Union towards the junction with the Wendover Arm.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst we were travelling in and around London, the trees around us were busy with bright green parakeets, shouting at one another and generally making a lot of fuss! Otherwise we had our familiar heron, cormorants, gulls, ducks, geese, swans, moorhens and coots, many of them now in family groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;City dwelling coots built their nests with colourful and interesting things woven amongst the twigs. Anything that floats was chosen from plastic bags and takeaway coffee cups to sweet wrappers and even a flip flop! Many of the nests were made on the back ends of boats and in tyres, suspended from boats as fenders. Some boats even had signs asking people not to double moor because they didn't want the coot nesting there to be disturbed!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Talking about wildlife using their initiative, I witnessed a crow catching a fish. He carried it from the canal in his beak to a nearby roof. I watched him as he ate it by pecking it to pieces rather than swallowing it head first as a water bird would have done. Well I never!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n49/P6012075cropped.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A blue sculpture of Paddington Bear doffing his hat to onlookers.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Bye Bye Paddington.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We discovered that Paddington's bit of canal has a special bubble curtain which keeps rubbish out and aerates the water. It is a metal tube, full of small holes, formed into a rectangle and positioned on the bottom of the canal where it has air pumped through it. It is a strange sensation, passing over it in the boat. It feels like the boat has briefly levitated. A small boat which has a conveyor belt tipped over the front of it, removes the debris collected behind the bubble curtain so that it can be disposed of. Clever ol' Paddington! Very neat!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After waving goodbye to dear ol’ Paddington, we turned onto the Regents Canal.
I have always wanted to travel along here, through Little Venice, the park, the zoo and Camden Lock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only zoo animal we saw was a very large pig but apart from that, the journey didn’t disappoint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The weather was beautiful and Camden was packed with people, on the bridges, in the bars and cafes, along the towpath and even enjoying picnics on the locks themselves! We had to ask people to move all their belongings before we could use the steps and swing the gates. The buzzing crowd seemed to be in holiday mood, enjoying the sunshine.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;A hot-tub boat.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Yes, really!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had hoped to moor at Limehouse, but there was no space for us so were forced to continue on. We finally found a place to moor at Bow Locks, just between the lock and the railway bridge. Whilst there we had a flying visit from Craig! Well, almost. He passed by us on a train, within a few feet of Liberty Belle!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We set off again the following morning and heard some lively music, which got louder and louder. Finally we came across the source, a boat crowded with people dancing. The party had spread to the outside of the boat and the tow path. We shouted across to them, asking if it was today's party or yesterday's. They confirmed it was yesterday's and invited us to join in. Feeling we would have a lot of catching up to do drink-wise, we waved cheerfully and declined...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We looped back to the Regents Canal, before retracing our journey to Little Venice and along Paddington’s Arm, before heading North along the Grand Onion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;At first we thought it was someone's answer to the homeless issue,&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;but no, it's office space. &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we arrived at the junction for the Slough Arm we slowed a little and just peered along it. We decided not to travel down it. Was that a mistake? Sorry Slough. Maybe next time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We try to plan ahead to some degree, plotting roughly where we want to be and when. We had spent rather more time in London than we had foreseen, so now we needed to move along without the luxury of exploring every town and village on the way. However, we do still want to travel the whole of the network if possible, so we try to travel along any canal arms that we can on our way, so that we don't have to come back to complete these extra bits of the network in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;(Maybe he's just in a huff..)&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;June had arrived and with it the heady smell of elderflowers, pretty pink wild roses draped over the hedges, waterlilies coming into bud and the occasional dragonfly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we left London behind we began to see Red Kites overhead, wagtails fussing around the locks and kingfishers dashing along in front of us again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Approaching Rickmansworth we could hear chanting. Rather than disturbing the peace, the sound was hypnotic and relaxing, although we had no idea what it was for. We searched the internet later and it turned out to be 'Prayer in the Park' held in a marquee near the canal to celebrate the end of Ramadan. It is obviously a very popular and well attended event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We joined forces with a pleasant young Londoner on his neat little boat with hops growing from pots at the bow. Apparently the hop plant doesn’t really like growing horizontally along the top of a boat but he was determined to make it work as he was brewing his own beer.
He was searching for a quiet mooring to leave his boat whilst he went for a week’s cider drinking in Cornwall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A week in Cornwall? Now there's an idea...&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;I think there is a boat under that lot.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;We had been looking forward to Cowroast Lock. It sounded so yummy!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;We were a little disappointed that there was no free BBQ,
but we did get lock gates so new that they still had the carpenter's marks on them.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n49/P6062211.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The non- slip raised 'buttons' on the lock gate crossing.&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;They also had fancy non-slip 'buttons' on them. Ooooo.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We turned down the Wendover Arm, which is under restoration. It is navigable for about 1.5 miles of its 6.75 mile length. We moored Liberty Belle near Tring where the canal currently terminates. Between rain showers we had a quick look around the town and the Church of St. Peter &amp;amp; St. Paul.  The next day the weather was better so we walked to Wendover, checking out the progress of the canal restoration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the return journey back to Liberty Belle we walked over a section of The Ridgeway from Wendover to Tring Park, which was a lovely discovery! The park used to belong to the Rothschilds. Walter Rothschild used to keep his wallabies, zebras, cassowaries and giant tortoises here in the late 1800’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apparently he had trained some of the zebras to pull a cart and used to ride one of the tortoises around, encouraging it forwards with a lettuce leaf! Brilliant!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now it is a haven for wildlife and has a network of well marked trails. After finding our way through the park we next discovered the Tring Natural History Museum (Walter Rothschild again) which took my breath away! For a small market town, Tring has a lot to offer!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On our way out of Tring, back to Liberty Belle, we almost managed to walk past the chippy...almost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After returning to the main canal from the Wendover Arm we travelled down the next arm to Aylesbury. The first two locks on this arm form a short staircase; the second lock is filled by the water expelled from the first. This makes you stop and think for a moment before operating them!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arriving at the third lock, the water was gushing into the lock over the gate at an alarming rate! I was convinced this must be my fault; I must have left the staircase lock in a state where the water was rapidly draining the canal! I dashed back to the staircase lock and couldn't see anything untoward, so we carried on down the locks, but I couldn't shake off the feeling that it was all my fault. Every lock along the arm had an excess of water, whereas there was generally a shortage...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was quite unnerving. We met some local people at a lock and I asked them if it was normal. They said it wasn't, and proceeded to take photos of the waterfall gushing over the lock gate. This wasn't reassuring. I asked them to forget that they had seen us, if it turned out to be my error!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After stopping over at Aylesbury we made our way back to the main canal. The water level was still very high all along the arm. Very odd - where was it all coming from?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we made our way to Milton Keynes, the weather took a turn! So far on our adventure we have only had occasional days of rain, but now we had a full week of it! We couldn't allow it to put us off as we had arranged to collect Cathy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some months before, I had been talking to a lock keeper about the lack of water and had suggested that maybe it would rain for the whole of June, to make up for it. Hmmmm...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We made good time, despite the weather. Cathy, on the other hand, had a difficult journey to Milton Keynes, having trains delayed and cancelled en route, but she got there in the end!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There had been some doubt about our journey beyond Milton Keynes because one of the locks was closed due to damage caused by an 'accidental collision' and a tree had been blown down across the canal. Thankfully the Canal &amp;amp; River Trust was able to complete the work required before it affected us. Well done to them!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The weather continued to be rather wet over the next few days but, with Cathy's help, we made good time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Tony had been fighting with his GPS tracker that turned out not to be as waterproof as we had thought. It failed to plot chunks of our journey so Tony had to manipulate the Liberty Belle maps himself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cathy had to leave us at Norton Junction, to make her way back to Bristol. This time her train journey was straightforward, thankfully.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This area between Berkhamsted and Milton Keynes is so unexpectedly delightful that we are thinking of coming back in the winter, to have more time to explore properly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our next assignment was to get to Leamington Spa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We ticked off the miles and locks with ease. The Yellow Flag Irises that have cheered us along our way are gradually dying back but we are now accompanied by an array of flowers of different colours and shades, including bright red poppies, cheerful Ox-eye Daisies and the determined Red Valerian.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the last day the sun finally came out. We completed the locks and miles in good time and arrived in Leamington Spa, looking for a safe place to moor Liberty Belle near the railway station. We found a stretch along the towpath which wasn't included in the 48 hour mooring signs, so we decided that Liberty Belle could legitimately stay here for a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She can have a break whilst Tony and I go to Cornwall for a well earned rest.

&lt;h2&gt;23rd-31st May 2019&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/maps/NineMonthsMap.png&quot; alt=&quot;A map of the canals we have covered in out first nine months&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;We have been cruising for nine months of our planned two years aiming to cover most of the canal network. This is how much we have covered so far.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;We may need more time!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/maps/n48map.png&quot; alt=&quot;Our route&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Our route&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n48/P5231856.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Liberty Belle moopred beside Thames Lock at Brentford&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Welcome&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, there we were on the Thames hoping to travel into London.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going straight down the river is an option for narrowboats and, in fact, Liberty Belle has done that in a previous life, with different crew. However, this involves dealing with the tidal section of the river as well as HUGE boats and even some waves, so I chickened out of that...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other option is to approach London by riding on the back of the Grand Onion, which joins the Thames at Brentford. I thought this would be a much easier option but it still involves a bit of tidal river between Teddington Lock and The Thames Lock in Brentford, so some planning ahead is required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Boaters are required to give 48 hours notice to book passage through the lock at Brentford if the tide isn’t going to be at the correct position during normal lock operating times. One of the options for booking this was by email which seemed sensible as we could put all the relevant information down in writing, to avoid any confusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, on the Monday, an email was sent requesting passage through the Thames Lock at Brentford on the following Thursday at 19:30.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By Wednesday morning we were concerned that no confirmation email had arrived. Tony made a phone call. He was told he was talking to the London office but needed to speak to the Brentford office, so they attempted to put him through. This didn't work so they promised Tony a call back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tony phoned the lock keeper himself, in the hope that he would be of help, but he just repeated the correct procedure for booking. Fair enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No phone call came.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best option seemed to be to alter our plans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right then, plan B.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Get up at 5:00 on Thursday morning, get through Teddington Lock (manned) and get to Brentford Lock for 8:00 when there was a 30 minute window where the lock was going to be manned and the tide was right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the Wednesday afternoon Tony received a phone call (at last) from a woman who explained that we should give 48 hours notice.....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tony explained that we had done that, by email, but we had since altered our plans anyway. He tried to discuss the timings for passing through the locks according to the tide, but the woman on the phone didn't know anything about that....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n48/P5231837.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A view through the bridge at Kingston-Upon-Thames&quot; /&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Early morning start.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Passing under the bridge at Kingston-Upon-Thames.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, on the Thursday morning we got up at 5:00 and arrived at Teddington lock at 6:15. All went smoothly. The Lock Keeper, feeling chatty, asked us our plans for the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We’re going to go through the Tidal Lock at Brentford”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Looking concerned) “That won’t be operated until 8 o’clock”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We know. How long does it take to get there then?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“An hour and 20 minutes.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Looking confused)“So that should be just right then….”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You’ll be alright if the tide holds up otherwise you’ll be in the mud”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This conversation wasn’t very reassuring really.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n48/P1240899.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A view of Richmond Lock&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;I think it is Liberty Belle that is a bit tippy, not the lock...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Boldly onwards!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily Tony had taken the time and trouble to look on the internet at pictures of the turning from the Thames towards the Brentford Lock, otherwise we would have gone straight past it. There was a distinctive metal sculpture there, which Tony recognised just in time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, turning the corner, we arrived at the Thames Lock, Brentford, at 7:45. Perfect. There was surprisingly little room for boats to wait there. Already a small boat was tied up to a bollard in the lock mouth. There was another bollard, several feet above our heads, to the right of the lock. It would mean some reversing and faffing when the lock opened but there was no choice. Tony managed to tie Liberty Belle (precariously) to that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, with only one rope tied and the water slowly dropping, we waited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;8:00 came and no lock keeper arrived.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Liberty Belle was being slowly lowered towards the muddy bottom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;8:15. Still no lock keeper. Tony tried to phone the lock keeper with no luck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually, at 8:17, almost at the end of our 30 minute window, the lock keeper arrived and let us into the lock. Wow. Talk about stressful...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We passed through onto the canal. I was so relieved I wanted to cry!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We immediately found a mooring, 14 days for free with our own tap. Joy! (We only wanted one night but it was nice to have the option!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n48/P5241883.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Liberty Belle mored under a covered wharf&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Our mooring in Brentford.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was still early, so we walked to Kew Gardens to spend the rest of the day. On the way, Tony had a phone call in response to our request to book passage through the Brentford Lock.....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

but it was my personal favourite.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a stressful start, we had a delightful day at Kew and headed off the following morning. Golly, it's nice to be on a canal!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n48/P5241890.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Hanwell Locks and the wall of St Bernard's Hospital.&quot; /&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;More city dwelling cormorants...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John and Melissa managed to find us, (despite public transport trying to confuse them and get them lost!) and joined us for our journey into Paddington.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were delighted to find a 7 day mooring directly outside the station! Amazing!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The four of us went for an evening meal together. We had fish and chips so posh that we had a bottle of wine with it! Tony and I didn’t even know that was an option!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Our mooring for the week.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Outside Paddington Station, behind a 'Party Boat'.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was the start of a busy week exploring London on foot and by tube.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As well as spending some time with John and Melissa, we had a visit from Kirsty, with her mother &amp;amp; brother, and Robin joined us for a day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* 'The Julia Tour of London'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many thanks to Julia who guided us by text message around an area of London which she knows well. We wouldn't have discovered these treasures on our own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If all your guide books are at home the Bot, Julia, can be consulted and will provide useful information free of charge! Sometimes the information comes unprovoked. Thus...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;conversationlisten&quot;&gt;Julia: If you're anywhere near St Paul's/Barbican   ...Postman's Park is an interesting little diversion ..and free&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;conversationlisten&quot;&gt;Julia: Which is close to the sunken The Goldsmiths' Garden - small but beautiful at this time of year and also free&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;conversationtalk&quot;&gt;Tony: Thanks, may do Museum of London in Barbican so that would fit in nicely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;conversationlisten&quot;&gt;Julia: Ooh yes, that's at No 1 London Walls - just round the corner. Also very close is Little Britain ( just a road really) but if you then walk say, after the museum, through Little Britain  and then take a dog leg through St Barts, toward Smithfield, you go past a very ancient church which is beautiful inside and out - I'll look up its name. .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;conversationtalk&quot;&gt;Rachel: Julia  knows everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;conversationlisten&quot;&gt;Julia: Turns out it's called St Bartholomews! !! anyway there's a St Bartholomews the Great and The Less, it's ancient and fabulous. There's stuff on Google about it.   And the dog leg is a right/left, not a left/right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;conversationtalk&quot;&gt;Rachel: Thank you! We have an exciting day ahead!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;conversationlisten&quot;&gt;Julia: Then if you walked through Smithfield you could walk down St John Street /Road to St John's Gate which is not only the home of St John's ambulance but also the only original City gate still in tact and in its original position. This is very close to the Jerusalem inn -  best pub in London.  Also, the Three Kings in Clerkenwell is not far away - also a good pub. All thus is free except the pubs - obvs&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;conversationlisten&quot;&gt;Julia: If you do the St John's part of that walk,  just pop down Peter's Lane/White Horse Alley on your left to take a look at the building with cow/sheep heads going all the way up to the top.
Sorry, it's the Jerusalem Tavern not Inn and is closed at the weekends as it's in the city. Not far  to stumble then to Faringdon tube.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;conversationlisten&quot;&gt;Julia: This is the only bit of London I know&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;conversationtalk&quot;&gt;Rachel: Fabulous, thank you!&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Not far from the excellent 'Harrison's Coffee' shop which has been serving coffee, as the sign says, 'Since 2018' .&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After leaving Newbury we made our way towards Reading. We were accompanied by Black-Headed Gulls and terns swooping around us, as well as the sight and heady smell of hawthorn flowers. I witnessed one tern scooping a fish from the water, which was very exciting!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n47/P5161587.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A herd of cows heading for a drink across the towpath&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;These big beasts (some with very long, sharp horns), met me on the towpath!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;I had to bring to mind my Mother's cow herding advice...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n47/P5161591.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Rachel on the towpath relieved having survived the cows&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Post cow herding success. Thanks Mum!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We teamed up with a very smart Dutch barge style narrowboat called Sterrenstof, which I had admired when I saw it moored in Newbury. With the addition of this friendly crew of four, the locks and swing bridges were made much easier. We had planned to moor Liberty Belle for the night just before the tricky Reading locks but, as our partner boat was continuing through Reading, we decided to stick with them. Although the weirs here did make negotiating the locks just as difficult as we had expected, travelling together made it less worrying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n47/P1240703.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A swan with her brood of four cygnets swimming&quot; /&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Plenty of swans have had sucessful broods.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n47/P1240657.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A pair of geese with their brood of three goslings swimming&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;... and the geese!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once we reached the Thames we parted company, Sterrenstoff turned left and we turned right, towards Henley-on-Thames, where we were hoping to catch up with Chris and Sara.
The gulls and terns were on the river too, as well as Great Crested Grebes, Egyptian Geese, Mandarin Ducks... we even saw a Sparrowhawk which was being mobbed by starlings.
Our binoculars became invaluable, enabling us to read any notices along the bank from a distance. In this way we could find where to moor before it was too late and we were committed to passing by!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n47/P5161609.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A view of the Thames from Liberty Belle&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;So wide!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The locks on the Thames are very large, electrically operated and quite often manned by lock keepers. The rules are to switch off your engine and use the stern and bow ropes to keep the boat in position, close to the edge. All types of boats are mixed in together, so keeping big steel boats from knocking into plastic ones, or even inflatables, is vital. In manned locks this was easy, Tony took the stern and I took the bow. It was trickier when there was no lock keeper. In one case the plastic boat we were sharing with was a lone boater and one of us needed to press the buttons. Usually you can press each button in turn and rush back to your position at the ropes but in this instance, the buttons needed to be pressed for 10 seconds every 2 minutes to operate the sluices so Tony was on his own rope-wise. It all went smoothly but it was a bit tense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n47/P5171619.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A house with a boathouse underneath for sale on the Thames&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;We spotted this semi for sale but Liberty Belle pointed out that the boat house was a bit short, so we didn't go ahead with the purchase...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just before Henley-on-Thames, the lock keeper suggested we travel past the moorings towards the centre of town before turning and tying up at the first mooring we come to, as near Henley as possible. Cunning! We are not used to having such a wide expanse of water to turn whenever we feel like it. The moorings were lovely and convenient but needed to be paid for. Fair enough...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n47/P5171633.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The New Orleans paddle steamer owned by Hobbs of Henley&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;A Paddle Steamer!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Well, sort of...it has a diesel engine. It was built to be as large as possible but still fit into the locks and pass under the Henley bridge&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following morning, through a cloud of mayflies, we watched a pair of coots making their nest whilst we waited for our visitors. The male coot spent his time swimming off to find nesting material, proudly returning with a stick or leaf in his beak which he presented to the female to arrange in the nest, then immediately dashing off to find the next one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chris and Sara found us and were introduced, first to Liberty Belle and then to the delights of Wetherspoons!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After second breakfast there, we had a little look around the town and went into the tourist information office. The extremely efficient employee there told us that we would like to go for a walk, which direction we would like to go in and gave us a train timetable to help us get back. Golly!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, as per instructions, we followed the Thames Path. Strangely it left the river at the lock and continued away from the Thames to the railway station. Here we found a pub garden, where we had a pint in the sunshine. We then turned back, planning to retrace our steps before following the path in the opposite direction, hopefully along the river. As we approached Liberty Belle, it began to rain so we sat in the boat and watched the coots, still building their nest. The rain became very heavy which seemed to clear away the mayflies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n47/IMG-20190518-WA0005.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Chris and Sara join us on the deck of Liberty Belle&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Visitors!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day the coots' nest was empty and there was no sign of the owners...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we left Henley we found ourselves confronted with the Regatta route. The river was divided into 3 lanes, each one wide enough for several large boats - the one on the far right had a sign indicating that we should go to the left of it; the centre lane was full of rowing boats; the far left lane seemed to be free. So, not wishing to get in the way of the early morning rowing practice, we headed for the far left. After much yelling from a coxswain we realised we were supposed to go down the middle lane. The narrow boat equivalent of an emergency stop is a painfully slow and embarrassing half-pirouette which we performed mid-river with a large audience of rowers...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n47/P1240653.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Liberty Bell passing a team of rowers&quot; /&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Our next obstacle, a swimmer!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We set off for Marlow, keeping an eye open for Chris and Sara who were planning to go canoeing on the river there, but we didn't see them. When we arrived the only mooring space available was half the size we needed but we managed to moor Liberty Belle's rear end properly and tie her bow to a tree. The indignity of it all!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Off we went for a walk uphill, hoping to find the viewpoint indicated on the map and get some photos of the river from above. Sadly the trees were too high and obscured the view. We did, however, find an elephant lurking amongst the bins behind some houses on the hill, so the climb wasn't wasted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During our stay in Marlow there was a food and music festival called ' The Pub in the Park'. After our climb we decided to sit on a bench outside the festival and listen to the music (it was much too expensive to go in...). Unfortunately we chose to do this during the hour when the daytime visitors were leaving and the ground was being prepared for the evening crowd, so no music. We returned to the boat and watched the acrobatics of a tern instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;An elephant.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our next mooring was in Maidenhead where we could stay for 24 hours for £8. We were beginning to get used to paying. There was plenty of room so we decided to moor alongside some convenient steps and Tony went off to pay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n47/P5211712.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A 'Passenger Boat Moorings' sign on the wall beside the river&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Surely these two signs are no longer relevant....&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n47/P5211708.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Another 'Passenger Boat Moorings' sign on the wall beside the river&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n47/P5211709.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A more recent '24hr Moorings charge £8' sign on the wall beside the river&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;... and have been superseded by the sign that has been attached to the wall between them...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had intended to stop off at Cookham village on the way to Maidenhead but it would have cost us £8 to moor for a brief look around. Now that we were safely moored we decided to walk back there instead. It was a lovely walk and we treated ourselves to a cream tea there before walking back via the delightful Ray Mill Island park, with its aviary and cage of busy guinea pigs (as well as very nice ice-cream....).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

which shows an aerial view of the village.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After dinner we wandered into Maidenhead town which was a bit confused in its layout and rather a disappointment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so to bed....briefly!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suddenly there were bright lights outside the porthole and the sound of people calling to each other, followed by a loud hooting noise. I peeped out and saw the hull of a huge boat right outside the window. Crikey. We hurriedly got dressed and went outside to find a large trip boat trying to moor up exactly where we were! Double crikey!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The crew were very patient with us and helped to move Liberty Belle a few feet along the landing stage and re-moor us. That done, they unloaded their passengers up the steps and went on their way.
Full of adrenaline, we tried to get to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Windsor was next! £10 a night to moor there (despite a lack of mooring rings), which was collected remarkably promptly! I have always wanted to explore Windsor and it didn't disappoint. The beautiful weather helped too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;No! Really? Good grief.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Windsor we went to Kingston-upon-Thames, arriving there quite late in the day. We were a little concerned about the possibility of mooring but we shouldn't have worried as there was plenty of room and it was free for 24 hours! We did however have to register our boat on a website which Tony couldn't get to work.....it turned out that the site was usable on a phone but not on a laptop. Please test your software before insisting that people use it and threatening them with a fine...grrrr.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, during these few days, Tony had been worrying about getting through the tidal lock on the Thames. But that's another story!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rachel Glombek</name></author><summary type="html">From Newbury to Kingston-Upon-Thames 15th - 22nd May 2019</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Many Hands…</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/libertybellenewsletter/2019/05/28/many-hands.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Many Hands..." /><published>2019-05-28T09:12:00+01:00</published><updated>2019-05-28T09:12:00+01:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/libertybellenewsletter/2019/05/28/many-hands</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/libertybellenewsletter/2019/05/28/many-hands.html">&lt;h2&gt;From Bradford-on-Avon to Newbury&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;9th - 14th May 2019&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Our route&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Gongoozling Calves&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to keep ourselves informed about the closure of locks on our way, we have signed up for automatic information emails from the Canal &amp;amp; River Trust (we receive several a day).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A recent email had informed us about a widebeam boat caught in a lock that was too narrow for it. It took some time to release the boat, by which time there was quite a queue of boats waiting to pass through. This lock was some way ahead of us at the time and the drama was all over before we reached the area. However, as soon as we did arrive at the lock, it was obvious that it was the one involved! Layers of brick had been removed from the sides of the exit. What a mess!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n46/P5091458.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;2&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The warning on the lock arm suggests boats should leave one at a time (so that they don't get wedged against the walls) but a widebeam is a single boat of double width, so no chance of that.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n46/P5091457.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;3&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The brick sides of the exit have been removed. It must have been very difficult with the boat wedged in situ. Goodness knows what state the boat's paintwork is in...!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We left Bradford-on-Avon with the hope of getting to Newbury by 14th May to catch up with John and Viv. During the day we were lucky enough to team up with another boat, making the locks easier. This was a hire boat, crewed by two friends that both happened to have 'Holiday on a Canal Boat' on their bucket-lists, so they had decided to go together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The time passed pleasantly, chatting with the woman as we worked the locks together. I asked her whether she planned to holiday on a boat again sometime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;No.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She seemed quite definite!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We finally managed to moor for lunch at 4pm at the bottom of the Caen Hill locks, having forfeited another meal!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n46/IMG_20190509_081541_cropped.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;4&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;A duck looking through our side hatch, hoping for breakfast!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At breakfast the following morning, a boat passed us, approaching the first of the day's 29 locks. We dashed outside to ask if they would consider waiting a couple of minutes so that we could partner with them. They agreed so we hurriedly got ready and set off. We were definitely in luck. The weather was sunny, our lock partners were friendly, good company and plentiful!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The boat belonged to a couple who were setting off for a 3 month adventure and were accompanied by friends and family to see them on their way. The helmsmen practised moving out of one lock and into the next together, side-by-side, instead of moving one at a time, which worked very well. With the help of all these lovely people we got through the Caen Hill flight of locks before lunch! Our partners moored up beside a pub, and we carried on to do the last couple of locks on our own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; As we completed the last lock we were lucky enough to witness a boat leaving a mooring in front of us and we were able to slip Liberty Belle straight into the space. This gave us plenty of time to visit the local launderette, have tea and cake then explore the shops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n46/P5101470.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;5&quot; /&gt;

 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n46/P5101463.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;6&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Synchronised boating.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following morning, after cruising for a while, I suddenly realised that I had left my windlass in Devizes... Oh no! This was the one Tony had bought for me at the beginning of our adventure, so it was a sad loss. We do, however, have several spares, so not a disaster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did some of the steering and felt confident enough to think I could control Liberty Belle in front of a swing bridge and let Tony step off to open it. Well, I didn't quite hit the moored boats nor did I actually bash into the side of the bridge, but for the next swing bridge, I tied Liberty Belle up until I could steer straight through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n46/P5111495.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;7&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Steering for a change...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later, as Tony was guiding Liberty Belle past some moored boats, a widebeam boat called Rachel came into view, heading in the opposite direction. Tony moved over slightly and there was plenty of room. We were just joking about Rachels being broad in the beam when she suddenly started heading straight for us! We had nowhere to go to get out of the way and she rammed us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course we were then in danger of hitting the moored boats, so I tried to fend them off whilst Tony tried to steer us out of trouble. There was no apology or even eye contact from Rachel's crew! Flippin' 'eck! Don't insult Rachels. Just don't.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n46/P5111483.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;8&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;'Rachel' just before she headed straight for us.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We moored up briefly at the water tap outside The Barge Inn at Honeystreet and were told that it would be opening on 24th May, and asked to spread the word. Consider it done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n46/IMG-20190511-WA0000.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;9&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The Barge in Honeystreet has changed hands and been closed for quite some time for refurbishment. At the time of writing this newsletter, it should be open.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Continuing on our way we saw our first cygnets of the year and glimpsed our first bluebells through the trees. We were also seen off by a brave swan who escorted us to the edge of his territory. He seemed quite proud that he had seen off such a large creature. Well done Mr. Swan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n46/P5111484.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;10&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Okay, okay Mr. Swan, we're leaving as fast as we can!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n46/P5111481.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;11&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Congratulations on your brood, Mrs. Swan!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later in the day we teamed up with a loan boater, Andy, to do the locks. He works for a marina, moving boats around the network. It seems that his work is a bit hit-and-miss but he has been working 7 days a week most weeks since Christmas. He tries to get as many miles done as he can each day but it is very hard work without crew so he likes to share the locks whenever possible. He was friendly and chatty and the partnership worked well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a lovely day full of cuckoos, swallows, kingfishers, red kites (often being mobbed by other birds), ducklings, goslings, cygnets, and wagtails nesting in the locks gates. The canal was covered in a white carpet of downy willow tree seed 'fluff'. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As evening approached we found a single mooring space so we shared it with Andy by tying the two boats side by side. We agreed to set off early the next morning and continue our partnership. Andy explained that the Kennet &amp;amp; Avon is so low on water for the time of year that it is in danger of being closed so we should get outta here. Enough said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next morning we set off as planned and completed our journey to Hungerford in very good time. We moored there for the night and Andy carried on, he had more to do than us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Hungerford, we shared locks with a boat called Matilda and her husband &amp;amp; wife crew. We moored in Newbury, one behind the other, in the perfect place, pretty and centrally located. We had a little look around and found ourselves in a canalside cafe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John and Viv managed to find us the following day and we explored Newbury with our guests. Yet again we were lucky with the weather and had a delightful day.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Sunshine above and below&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After leaving Bath we, (Tony, Mary and myself), decided it would be nice to moor up near to the Dundas Aqueduct and take a stroll across it before visiting the nearby village of Monkton Coombe. Having checked our map to find the number of the bridge nearest to the aqueduct, we travelled along until we reached that bridge and moored nearby.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We set off for our walk. We walked on... and on... much further than we had expected. It turned out that the bridges on the map had been incorrectly numbered! Good grief.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n45/P5031367.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;2&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;A boat called Brexit (partially sunk)&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;We first saw this boat when several Europeans, (Germans, I think), were posing in front of it, laughing and taking photos...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally we arrived at the aqueduct, shook off the Canal &amp;amp; River Trust chappy (who wanted us to donate on a monthly basis) and walked into Monkton Coombe for a little look around. We then had a nice big lunch to prepare us for the walk back...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Lunch&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the up side, we were moored closer to the historic Claverton Pumping Station than we had expected and the volunteers were going to be running it whilst we were there, so the next morning we set off to investigate. After an interesting look around we were about to leave when we were offered a guided tour. The young man that guided us made it all even more fascinating, so it was well worth the visit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pump was built to feed water from the river into the canal above. It is driven by a water wheel, rotated by the flow of the river. Unfortunately, the water cannot now be pumped into the canal because the modern pumping station uses the same pipes and cannot be disrupted. This means the pumped water is piped back into the river, behind the wheel, which gives the impression of the station &quot;lifting itself up by its own boot straps&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst we were here, Mary spotted a fox running alongside the canal, so we were able to add him to our list of wildlife spotted on our journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n45/P5041385.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;5&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Claverton Pumping Station which recently became a Grade 1 listed building.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We cruised along, finally reaching the Dundas Aqueduct where we stopped to take on water. Suddenly there was a great kerfuffle in a nearby hedge. A woman passing by investigated and tried to intervene. Tony too, went to have a look. A magpie was being ineffectually attacked by a pair of blackbirds as it ate the contents of their nest. The woman trying to 'shoo' it away didn't have any effect either. I know it's just nature, but I am glad I didn't witness it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On that sad note, we crossed this aqueduct and moored just before the next one at Avoncliff. We had a quick look around and decided we would have a better look and a pub lunch the following day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The view from the Avoncliff Aqueduct.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it turned out, Tony went for an early walk the next morning to look at the mooring possibilities in Bradford-on-Avon and came back full of enthusiasm for moving on because there were a couple of spaces in a prime position, so Avoncliff's delights would have to wait for another visit...
(We did, however, get our pub lunch, in Bradford-on-Avon.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We took Mary for a look around the town, including the Tithe Barn and three very different churches. One Norman church (laid out very much in the way we expect and visited by us on our first visit to Bradford-on-Avon), one fascinating Saxon church (nothing like any others we have seen) and one which had been built as a town hall originally, rejected by the town, adopted by the Catholic church and looking very much like a town hall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n45/P5051434.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;8&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;A 14th century barn in Bradford on Avon, which, despite probably not being used for collecting tithes, is called The Tithe Barn.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n45/P5051454.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;9&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The use of the Saxon Church in Bradford on Avon is not in doubt but its age is. It was built somewhere between the 8th and the 11th century. What's 300 years between friends?&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following day we had visitors! Claire and Keith came to meet Liberty Belle and have a look around Bradford-on-Avon. The weather did us proud so they were able to see the town at it's best. We visited the Bradford-on-Avon Millennium Embroidery, the Iron Duke Rubber Roller (or Calendar, confusingly), the reconstructed old Chemist shop in the museum (exactly like the one Mary used to work in), and the Secret Garden Cafe for you-know-what. After a lovely day they set off for home, taking Tony with them!

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Mary back in a Chemist shop, surrounded by familiar equipment, fittings and stock.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whist Tony was at the house, weeding the drive, Mary and I had a final look around Bradford-on-Avon and a pub lunch (this is becoming a habit!) before Mary caught her train home. I was suddenly alone...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The weather was still sunny so I decided not to waste it and went for a walk to Avoncliff, to see what we had missed. Well, nothing, as it turned out!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to walk back on a footpath along the river, next to the canal. It was all very lovely with the added excitement of a living-willow labyrinth and a pond, teeming with tadpoles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wednesday's weather was in complete contrast, with rain, hail and thunderstorms. Tony gave up gardening and took the train back to Liberty Belle where we sat out the bad weather, planning our next move...&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Another beautiful day.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 24th April is Tony’s birthday! After opening his card (not from me, you understand) and hanging it up, we moved Liberty Belle nearer to Bath Spa station and went food shopping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By 11:30 we were waiting at the station for Mary to arrive. We had 2 exits covered but she came out at the third! She nearly went to Leamington Spa, (we are still not sure whether it was her mistake or that of the ticket office) so it could have been worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My cousin, Robyn, caught up with us in the afternoon so we had a long chat, a cuppa and a stroll to take in the views. We all agreed that she lives in a lovely city!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n44/P4241154.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;3&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;On both visits to Bath, Liberty Belle spent some time moored next to this sundial. If the sun was shining, we could see what time it was...Oh well, we'll call it lunch time, just in case.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following morning, Rose joined us for second breakfast. After opening his second birthday card and hanging it up, we all set off for Keynsham. Rose volunteered to help me fight with some of the locks which sped up the proceedings, particularly for the deep lock in Bath.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along the way we attempted to tie up outside one of the Canal &amp;amp; River Trust facilities moorings, which was tricky due to certain boats being permanently moored there....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along the canals, the Canal &amp;amp; River Trust provide certain facilities for boaters. These consist of one or more of the following:- a water tap; elsan disposal; toilet tank pump out; toilets; rubbish bins; recycling facilities (rare); showers (very rare). Boats should only moor at these facilities for the short time it takes to use them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In areas where people are likely to want to stay, near shops and pubs, visitor moorings are provided which are restricted to a specified number of days. As there are very few of them on the Kennet &amp;amp; Avon, these moorings are usually restricted to 1 or 2 days. It is very difficult to moor alongside the towpath on this canal because the boats become grounded before they are close enough to the edge for the crew to alight. As a consequence of this, many of the visitor moorings (and even facilities moorings) have been adopted as permanent moorings, disregarding the restrictions. This is very frustrating....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we travelled along Rose was able to point out beauty and colours where I only saw rusty bridges and dilapidated walls... This journey is wasted on me. Maybe someone should write a Rose App that enables you to film things as you go along and points out how beautiful it all is. Or maybe I should just learn to observe...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We kept our eyes peeled for a lunch time mooring but found nothing until Keynsham, at about 3pm, where we took the last remaining visitor mooring. Rose had to leave us there and catch a train home, a little later than she had planned. Thank you, Rose, for a lovely day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n44/P4251165.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;4&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Bath Deep Lock&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Just look at the height of those gates! They are so heavy that they are opened &amp;amp; closed using a winding mechanism, not pushed like the others. This seems to take forever....&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Bath Deep Lock is the second deepest lock in the country at 19ft 5ins (we didn't measure it ourselves...). It has the combined depth of the two locks that it replaced during the restoration of the canal in 1976. A road was built over the original site of one of those locks.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bristol Harbour is tidal, so, before entering the harbour, it is necessary to contact the Harbour Master or the keeper of the tidal lock to get permission to continue. Tony attempted several times to book our passage through the lock into the harbour. When he finally managed to get through, he informed them that one of their numbers didn't seem to work at all. The lock keeper was surprised that the number was still being given out as it belonged to a phone that had fallen into the lock a year ago... Well, no wonder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lock itself had been left open but we needed to stop and buy our Bristol Harbour licence. We tied up, making sure we avoided a pole sticking out horizontally from the pontoon looking all the world like an eye-poker-outer. It turned out that the pole had been put there at the same height as the lowest bridge in the harbour to indicate whether we would fit under it or not. It was going to be a tight squeeze, but it wouldn't need to be lifted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With our 3 day licence, some indication of where we could moor and the advice to 'navigate the bridges as best you know', off we went.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we got closer the rain poured down in torrents. We contacted Cathy and she confirmed that there was mooring space outside the 'Vegetable Diva', where she works. Hurray!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we tried to moor the wind picked up and kept Liberty Belle pinned against the end of one of the pontoon 'fingers' that we were trying to swing past. The lady operating the ferry took pity on us, stood on the end of the 'finger' and heaved Liberty Belle past it and into our mooring. Well done and many thanks to her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cathy, who was just finishing her break, saw us arrive and rushed out to greet us but had to immediately return to work.  As it was getting late we stopped to have lunch on the boat before visiting Cathy at her place of work for a coffee. We immediately realised that we should have saved ourselves for something from the cafe because the savoury treats looked absolutely wonderful. I was determined that we would buy some of them the following day. After finishing work Cathy joined us on Liberty Belle for the evening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Hello Bristol!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The wind only got worse overnight. As the waves thrashed against the side of the boat, it sounded like an ogre was tramping up and down on the roof, moaning and groaning… Mary got up a couple of times in the night to check that we weren’t untied and floating off out to sea!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n44/IMG-20190427-WA0007.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;7&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Waves slapping about at our mooring.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite all the noise, we got through the night unscathed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the morning Cathy and Will escorted us as we were blown around Bristol for the day, dodging in and out of museums, shops and cafes. Joe managed to track us down and joined us for lunch, making 6 of us, quite a family gathering! This could have been tricky in Mokoko, but we managed to commandeer the only table large enough for us in the cafe - Cathy and I can look quite threatening when necessary! Later we all returned to Liberty Belle for the evening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following morning the weather was comparatively calm. There were several rowing teams out on the water. Joe joined us for the morning for a coffee in Pinkmans and a look around the excellent Bristol Museum and Art Gallery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will joined us for lunch at the Christmas Steps pub, after which Joe set off for home and we, (Tony, Mary and myself) set off for the SS Great Britain. We found plenty to interest us en route and by the time we arrived it was almost time for Cathy to finish work. We got straight onto the ferry back to Liberty Belle and I rushed to buy a few yummy things for tea time from her in the ‘Vegetable Diva’. Soon afterwards Cathy arrived with more nice things to eat, shortly followed by Will with even more goodies, so we shared a delicious feast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the Monday morning Cathy returned to Liberty Belle and became our helmsman for a couple of days. We had planned to moor at Keynsham the first night but there was no space for us so we had to carry on all the way to Bath where we moored on the river. Well done Cathy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The Kennet and Avon is partly river and partly canal bypassing unnavigable parts of the river. A weir accompanies each lock on the canal stretches allowing surplus water to flow into the nearby river.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;No, we haven't taken a wrong turn and ended up in the Everglades but we have found a turtle! (Cathy gets the prize for spotting him)&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We wandered around Bath, taking in the sights, including the Abbey and covered market. We ate excellent pies in The Raven at lunch time, then, in the afternoon, Cathy took Liberty Belle through the 3 locks to the mooring space we had used the the week before. During the evening Cathy had to leave us and caught the train back to Bristol.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mary, Tony and I joined a free walking tour of Bath, available every day and worth every penny! We had a very pleasant and knowledgeable guide who kept us interested for over 2 hours. In the afternoon, Tony and I left Mary on Liberty Belle, reading her book, whilst we went for a walk uphill to get some views of Bath. We do like this city and are already planning to return (probably by train to avoid cruising back through Reading...).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the success of Wednesday's tour we decided to stay for another day and join a different tour, which was also interesting. Feeling that we had now seen some of Bath and maybe learnt a little bit about it, we set off in the afternoon. Before long the weather turned and we got soaked to the skin! We moored up as soon as we found a space, because we couldn’t take any more. We found ourselves in Bathampton for the night, just 2 miles and 3 locks away from our Bath mooring. Oh well!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rachel Glombek</name></author><summary type="html">Bath to Bristol and Back Again (via the Everglades) 24th April - 1st May 2019</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Bath Time</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/libertybellenewsletter/2019/05/10/bath-time.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Bath Time" /><published>2019-05-10T09:04:00+01:00</published><updated>2019-05-10T09:04:00+01:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/libertybellenewsletter/2019/05/10/bath-time</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/libertybellenewsletter/2019/05/10/bath-time.html">&lt;h2&gt;Woolhampton to Bath&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;16th - 23rd April 2019&lt;/h2&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We left Woolhampton full of trepidation, wondering what the Kennet and Avon would throw at us next. It turned out to be a confused electronically operated swing bridge. Having waited for the pedestrians on the towpath to cross over the bridge, I pressed the appropriate buttons to lower the barriers and start the swinging process. Before it had opened enough to let Liberty Belle go through, it stopped. According to a passer-by, it had been fixed the day before... By now, more pedestrians were gathering on the towpath, waiting to cross and Tony was wondering what was taking so long. I pressed the button required to swing the bridge back across the canal and there was some movement, which was encouraging. Tony tied Liberty Belle up and came to investigate. I allowed the bridge to shut again and re-started the process. This time the bridge behaved exactly as it should, opening wide to allow Tony to guide Liberty Belle through. It also closed perfectly and we were off again. Phew.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We passed through Newbury, where we should have been moored back in February for my Mum's birthday - just a bit late. There, we teamed up with another boat, a hire boat with a crew of 10, covering 3 generations of a family, and worked the locks together. We had a short delay, (OK, a long delay), when one of their crew threw the rope from the boat in the direction of a waiting crew member on the tow path, and the rope fell in the water. There was a terrible sound as the rope wrapped itself many, many times around the propeller.  Liberty Belle was waiting in the lock for the other boat to join her. After a while, two more boats arrived and tied up patiently. Just as we were about to give the lock to these newcomers there was a cheer and the offending rope was held aloft. We were off!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Kintbury we managed to squeeze into the last available mooring. It could have been argued that we were partially blocking the bridge so we planned an early start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Our mooring for the night. Liberty Belle just squeezed in before the bridge. Note the ambitious gradient of the railway track on the side of the bridge.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We managed to set off before anyone had time to complain about our mooring. Entering a lock we noticed a boat following behind us so we waited for them to catch up. A young man, jogging along the towpath, stopped to help at the lock by opening the second gate. I thanked him. I was a little surprised that he should stop his jog for us. He explained that he was holidaying on the approaching boat and was a little put out that they had set off whilst he was on his run....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There appeared to be two other young people on the boat but as we all waited for the lock to fill, several more young people gradually emerged, buttoning up their clothes, or eating cereal, or cleaning their teeth…. Obviously two of the crew were much too impatient to wait for the others to be ready. We shared the locks with them until they turned around just before Hungerford.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After lunch and a quick look around the town we teamed up with another boat, 'First Light', owned by Colin and Julie who are on the same adventure as us! This is the first couple we have met that are continuous cruisers planning to complete the whole network. Obviously we had a lot to chat about. Our first encounter together was a collapsed swing bridge, crawling with Canal &amp;amp; River Trust people rapidly repairing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, out of nowhere, Beckie and Buddy appeared! It was an amazing surprise. They were able to join us on board for a little while until we arrived at the bridge where Beckie had left her car.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Great Bedwyn, First Light moored up and we said goodbye to Colin &amp;amp; Julie. We continued on to our mooring for the night, alongside a field of delightful pigs who ignored us completely. I briefly thought we had a very different neighbour in another field - a large kind of deer or elk. I was very excited! However, when it lifted it’s head, its antlers remained on the floor, now looking like a fallen branch. The strange creature was a donkey. I do like donkeys but it was still a bit of a disappointment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n43/P4170988.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;5&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Surprise visitors!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After checking on the pigs, (fast asleep in a bundled heap in their cosy house), we set off through 10 locks and a tunnel. The tunnel was short and we were able to see a heron framed in the circle made by the far end of the tunnel and it’s reflection. It was a beautiful sight, gradually becoming closer and closer. Just as we were about to emerge from the tunnel I tried to take a photo of the heron but, of course, it flew away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We arrived at Honeystreet and were able to moor up directly outside the Barge Inn. The perfect mooring! I have always wanted to moor there. Unfortunately the pub was closed for refurbishment. No wonder the mooring was available. Hmm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Robin joined us there and, to make up for our disappointment at finding the pub closed, he drove us to another pub and bought us dinner. What made it even more delightful was the pub parrot. He didn’t speak to us at all on the way in, but as we left he clearly said&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Goodbye. Thankyou.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fabulous!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n43/P4181007.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;6&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Good luck Mrs Swan.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;A very cute boat.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following morning we waited in Honeystreet for the Devizes to Westminster canoe race to pass by. We had no desire to get muddled up in that. Whilst we waited we all got some jobs done. Once it was clear, Robin drove off to park his car in Devizes and we set off in Liberty Belle. Robin cycled back along the towpath and met us at a swing bridge where he and his bike boarded Liberty Belle and we arrived in Devizes together where we met up with the Bradshaws and Julie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Julie &amp;amp; Robin as extra crew members we flew down the Caen Hill locks, fuelled by ice cream, tea &amp;amp; biscuits and lager, in that order. After a well deserved lunch, Robin and Julie each went on their way. We sat in the shade on the towpath and enjoyed a relaxing cuppa. Later Joe joined us on his way home from a road trip to Scotland and the Lakes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Still going after all those locks!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next morning Joe crewed with us for a while before returning to his van and heading home. We continued on to Bradford-on-Avon, where we shared the last lock with a hire boat. The boat was a long one and the stern of the boat was subjected to a lot of water spray whilst in the lock. Tony felt sorry for the woman at the helm and let her out of the lock first, despite the concern that she might take the best mooring space! Fortunately, her boat was too long to fit into the space we wanted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a stroll around Bradford-on-Avon we bumped into a woman from the boat we shared the Caen Hill locks with the day before, which was nice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n43/P4211068.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;11&quot; /&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a short stay in the delightful Bradford-on-Avon we set off for Bath. The countryside was beautiful. There were lots of boats to see on the way, in varying states of repair (or dis-repair). We moored on the outskirts of Bath, just before Sydney gardens then went for a stroll to see if there were any other moorings available nearer the railway station. We were due to meet Mary off her train the next day. Having found what we wanted, we had a quick look around Bath and decided we like it.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Passing through Somerton Deep Lock again, this time with blooming Forsythia&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we returned to Liberty Belle, waiting for us in Banbury, we had plans....Reading by Friday, (to meet Robin and Julie), then Bath by Easter! Hahaha!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First we had to give Liberty Belle a service with the help of Bill the Engineer. This took flippin’ hours but a proper job was done. So, later than expected, at 14:30, we left Banbury and tried to get to Aynho Wharf for fuel before they closed.... It was slow going, especially when we tried to fill Aynho Weir Lock. The previous users had left one of the paddles up slightly, allowing the lock to leak and preventing it from filling completely.... Grrr...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were nearly there, hoping that they would still be open at 18:00 when we were likely to arrive, when we met a chap that informed us that they closed at 15:30 at this time of year. Oh flip! We now had to moor there overnight so that we could refuel when they opened at 9 am. This meant that we hadn’t done as many miles as we had hoped and we wouldn’t get the early start we needed the next day. Already things were not going to plan....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After this set back, the revised plan is to get to Oxford by Friday, which is far more achievable.
Once we had a tank full of fuel we set off from Aynho. As we were coming into Somerton Tony noticed someone walking along the towpath towards us who looked like Neil and walked like Neil. It turned out to BE Neil! It seems he wasn't in Spain, as we had thought! Once we had managed to get him on board and found a mooring space we stopped for a cuppa and a slice of cake, kindly provided by our surprise guest. It was only a short visit as he was on his way North. He left us with the remains of the cake and walked the few yards back to his car. (We had finished the cake before he drove off....)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later in the day we had a slightly traumatic experience when coming alongside the towpath to let me off for a lock. We almost trapped a duck and her ducklings! Mother duck knew to race along to the rear of the boat but the ducklings swam in confused circles with Liberty Belle giving them less and less room! Mother duck was quacking and encouraging them to follow her and they where chirping and darting about in all directions! At the last minute Mother duck managed to get her message across and all were safe... Phew.
We collected water from Thrupp and moored there for the night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
 &lt;img src=&quot;/libertybellenewsletter/image/small/n42/P4100848.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;2&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Don't forget me!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On leaving Thrupp  it was an easy trip into Oxford where we found a mooring quite near the Isis lock, the last one before the Thames. We went for a look around Oxford then cooked a curry ready for the weekend visitors. In the evening we went for a short walk in the hope of seeing some otters but were not in luck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;A raft used to monitor otter population. How exciting!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After getting the boat ready for our guests we went into Oxford for a snack in the Handlebar Cafe, which was delightful, then a look around the fascinating and utterly wonderful Pitt Rivers museum. Neil popped by to see us again on his way back South and we all went to collect Julie &amp;amp; Robin from the station before heading to Wetherspoons (Four Candles) for a meal. Robin had misunderstood the situation, thinking we would be travelling from Oxford to Reading in one day and had only paid for his car to stay in the Reading car park for 24 hours, so we spent some time downloading an App that would enable him to pay remotely for an extra day’s parking. Julie was trapped for a day longer than she had planned...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neil headed back to his car and the rest of us started our weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We began Saturday with a big breakfast and then set off onto the Thames. The river was not as wide there as we had anticipated, nor as busy. There were, however, a lot of rowing boats, which we somehow managed to avoid. All the locks were operated by push-button controls and most of them were manned by lock-keepers, so the going was easy. We completed about half of the trip between Oxford and Reading before mooring for the night alongside a slightly rough river's edge with trees and nettles at Shillingford bridge. We avoided the moorings next to the bridge as they were very smart and bound to be pricey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Our beautiful mooring space that we initially assumed was free...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early on Sunday morning, we began to suspect that our mooring place wasn’t free, as we had assumed, so we left hastily before someone charged us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we turned the corner, leaving the River Thames at Reading, I seem to remember seeing a friendly sign saying &quot;Welcome to the Kennet and Avon Canal&quot;.... Hmmm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The water was shallow and we struggled to manoeuvre. When we found somewhere to stop, to allow Robin &amp;amp; Julie to disembark, there was a sign with rather small writing. Having tied Liberty Belle up, we approached the sign and managed to read that, by stopping there, we now owed the 'up to 4 hours' fee of £4. If we stayed overnight we would owe £9:50. We were also informed that we had now been caught on CCTV and a failure to pay would result in a fine of £100. These moorings are owned by the council, offer no facilities except mooring rings and are not even secure. Robin and Julie disembarked and headed for Robin’s car whilst we moved Liberty Belle on with Tony muttering &quot;Just let them try...&quot; and immediately getting grounded on the corner. A bit of to-and-fro, back-and-forth and we were free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We travelled through the centre of Reading (no moorings here at all) before coming to a narrow stretch where traffic lights were in use to prevent boats from meeting head on. Boaters are expected to press a button, pedestrian crossing style, on the right hand side of the canal and wait up to 12 minutes for a green light. There is nowhere to tie up, nowhere to allow a crew member to step off the boat, so Tony had to try and swing Liberty Belle within reach of the button with me leaning over to press it. The light went green straight away so we avoided having to decide how to stay put for up to 12 minutes....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We thought this was tricky but it was nothing compared to the next 2 locks. Liberty Belle had to choose between obeying Tony and being swept away by the river rushing past the lock. Luckily, Tony won. If there had been any rain recently, the ending may have been different. We helped ourselves to a map of the Kennet and Avon, chuckling at the obvious error on the map. There was a symbol in the map’s key for mooring and it hadn’t been used on the map until Bath. Not so funny really, as it turned out… In reality, there are mooring spaces, but they are generally few and far between. If you want to stop alongside the towpath, which we have done many times on other canals, you risk coming aground before you are close enough to jump off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the second lock, where the river gives way to the man made canal, the mooring posts were well ahead of the lock due to the river rushing around and in front of the lock gates. The strong wind pushed us against the mooring which was handy for me to get off but tricky for Tony to get away and pick up enough speed to get through the river flow and into the lock. Once in, the flow of the water when the lock was filling was so crazy that I could only open the paddle a tiny amount before it got too tricky to control the boat. Unfortunately the water was leaking out of the bottom gates almost as quickly as it was flowing in through the paddle. Slowly Liberty Belle began to rise but became out of control so I dropped the paddle  to allow Tony to get control again. The filling of this lock took ages and it was all very stressful. &quot;Welcome to the Kennet and Avon&quot;. Yeah, right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the top of the lock was a different world of calm. Finally we were able to leave the lock and moor behind the other boats in the tranquil canal. We were exhausted.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Pull in alongside the short landing stage to let off your crew member then pull out again against the flow of the water....Thank goodness the water level is low!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;When the lock gates are open just make a mad dash at the lock, trying not to let the water push you away...&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the following day every lock had a nasty surprise and they were interspersed with lift bridges. Most of the bridges were electric, the traffic controlled by lights and barriers which are operated by buttons on a console. In order for the controls to work, a British Waterways Key needs to be turned in the keyhole and is only released when the bridge has been replaced. As we approached one particular bridge it became apparent that someone had already lifted it. The boat passing under the bridge had a single crew member so his key had been left in the control panel. Following him in quick succession were two other boats, each with a one-man crew. With a few shouted messages it became apparent that the helmsman of the third one was charged with retrieving the keys. He waited just beyond the bridge for us to pass under and for me to lower the bridge before he collected the key. It all went very smoothly. However, the van driver waiting for the bridge to be returned did not respond to my wave of thanks for being patient. Presumably because he wasn’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At about 4 o’clock we decided to give up finding a sensible place to moor for lunch and tie Liberty Belle to a couple of trees. I managed to jump from the bow onto a firm piece of land and wrap the rope around a tree as Tony nudged it with Liberty Belle's nose. Tony then brought the back end in and jumped, trusting that he would land with his feet on firm ground... He was just trying to secure the stern rope to the second tree when a passer by stopped and told us about some proper moorings just a few minutes away, beyond the next lock. I released the front and Tony returned the stern rope. Being a gentleman he allowed me to step aboard before him and got left behind on the towpath as Liberty Belle was swept to the other side of the river. I grabbed the tiller and managed to steer her back over without getting grounded... Golly.
By the time we had operated another lift bridge (with another impatient van driver) and charged Liberty Belle through the flow of the river across the front of the lock and through the lock gates, waited for the volunteers (bless their cotton socks) to refill the lock and release us, another hour had gone by. One of the lock keepers said he suspected that one of the moored boats at the top of the lock was about to leave and thus give us a space to moor. He went ahead of us and confirmed that this was the case. Thank you kind man! Phew. Lunch time at last!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Note: as we had lunch so late, we didn't have an evening meal. Tony has pointed out, on a regular basis ever since, that he has missed an entire meal.)&lt;/p&gt;
